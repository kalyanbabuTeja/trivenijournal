style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>My
first knowledge of Signor Alberto Moravia, the Italian author, was through his
novel. <i>Wheel of Fortune, </i>an English translation of which Messrs. Cassell
published in January 1938, exactly thirteen years ago. In one’s youth it was
tremendously exciting to come across a wholesale shattering of the conventional
ideas of mankind and its morals; Signor Moravia was thirty years old then and
he provided the excitement to its fullest measure in his novel. In the course
of decade, <i>The Fancy Dress Party, Agostino, The Women of Rome, </i>have been
his other productions in fiction; but the growing years do not seem to have
sobered him to any sort of synthesis. His deep awareness of essential
psychology propels him to revelations akin to volcanic eruptions, darkly,
desperately pessimistic. He has been compared with Dostoievesky which, largely,
is not incorrect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

</span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>is Signor Moravia’s latest. It is a study of a school-boy,
Luca by name, dealing with the critical period of his adolescence: his total
loss of interest in his lessons, his sense of sickening ennui, his violent
outbursts of rage, his repudiation of life not by thoughts of suicide but “by
an intense contemplation of the idea of death.” His first sexual awakening
comes through contact with his cousin’s young governess who dies suddenly,
which throws him into black despair and eventually into a serious illness. A
middle-aged nurse, ownner of a tender understanding heart, who is engaged by
his parents to attend on him, brings him back to health; his recovery, both
physical, and psychological, is complete when she finally initiates him into to
passionate intimacies of sex. “He had the precise feeling that she was taking
him by the hand and introducing him, a reverent novice into a mysterious cave,
dedicated to a religious rite. This, he thought was the life he had formerly
invoked, and little did it matter if it presented itself to him in the garb of
autumn.” Exact and exacting, convincing and conclusive, but Signor Moravia
never states the norm; a fundamental coldness makes him impervious to the
mellowness of sympathy, and this his study of an adolescent schoolboy fails to
achieve the glow and magical throb of life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Alberto Moravia to Guiseppe Marotta the change is from the abnormal to the
normal, from the deliberate to the casual, from the chill miasmal vapours to a
companionable warmth and light. <i>Neapolitan Gold </i>is dedicated to the
Comic Spirit. Meredith would have hailed it with extreme delight. “It
introduces”–the publisher’s blurb runs–“a new humorist to English readers.
Guiseppe Marotta, himself a Neapolitan by birth and upbringing, presents a
portrait of his native city alive with colour and vivacity, the warmth, brio,
and violence which endear the Italian temperament to the English heart.” A tear
behind the smile–that is what one finds in the twenty-two vignettes brought
together here–delicate sketches of character, not as types but as individuals,
the spice of variety–all human interest stories, miniatures illuminated with
the author’s special gifts of irony and paradox. To Signor Marotta a
knife-slash on the loved one’s face is merely “an endearing sort of madness,
something like a red ink signature to a love-letter.” A consummate artist whose
melancholy is compounded of sweetness and light.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the novelists well known outside France Gabriel Chevallier is one and perhaps
the most popular. In his fifties now M. Chevallier has been in turn a
draftsman, a commercial traveller, and a journalist. He admits to “a certain
penchant for beautiful women, good wines, automobiles, and independence.” A
magnificent story-teller, M. Chevallier’s qualities are various: wry wit,
Rabelaisian exuberance of humour, fecund invention, lyrical expressiveness. He
is a Master-hand in depicting bourgeois life as lived in the French provincial
towns; readers of his novels–<i>Clochmerle, Sainte Colline, The Euffe
Inheritance</i>–and that delightful volume of four long-short stories <i>Mascarade</i>–need<i>
</i>not be told about his technical virtuosity, his brilliant and perspicacious
assessment of human nature in all its strength and weaknesses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<i>Cherry, </i>one sees a new Chevallier, a sentimental Chevallier and quite
unabashed at that. His rhetorical splendours are: held in complete abeyance
here; this record of recollections of a little girl who was entrusted to his
care by her parents is enchanting in its simplicity, its sense of delicious fun
and joy. Cherry was an exacting child but M. Chevallier in his role as her
second father could not help succumbing to her infant wiles and charms. “To
watch a child passing through the stages of human progression,” M. Chevallier
remarks, “to observe the gradual growth of feelings, to note the part they play
and to what ends they are adapted, is to work along the lines of a biologist,
one who studies in the animal kingdom the principles of the evolution of the
species. M. Chevallier does the biologist’s job with matchless skill and
thoroughness, watching Cherry grow from childhood to youth, at which point he
takes leave of her. It is an absorbing narrative which may be welcomed not only
for its straightforwardness and lucidity but for its philosophy which caresses
an angel’s wings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Number Sixteen in the Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode Century Library which is
“designed to do for the best English fiction of the twentieth century what
Everyman has done for the classics as a whole.” <i>Saturday Night at the
Greyhound </i>achieved a first-class reputation when it was first published in
England by Leonard and Virginia Woolf at their famous Hogarth Press during the
Spring of 1931. It is the tale of a pub among the bleak Derbyshire Hills,
unfolding an intense drama of life: the pub is kept by Fred and his wife Ivy;
Fred drinks too much and is unfaithful to the loving and devoted Ivy, but there
is Tom, Ivy’s brother who is loyal to her and helps her out of her troubles.
The brother-and-sister relationship is wonderfully told; it is the one streak
of light, warm and golden, that relieves the greyness of the story. Mr. Hampson
betrays character by swift strokes of phrasing; his style is simple, supple,
vigorous; he is in the direct tradition of Daniel Defoe. He is the author of
several other novels–<i>Strip Jack Naked, Family Curse, 0 Providence, Care of
The Grand.</i><o:p></o:p></span></p>

present edition of <i>Saturday Night at the Greyhound </i>carries a brilliant
introduction by William Plomer. It is about the best appraisal of Mr. Hampson’s
merits as a writer. “The general flavour of his work,” says Mr. Plomer, “is what
may be called very English–because of its subject-matter, its sobriety and
directness and its discovery of deep and unsentimental tenderness: it is also
very personal, not because of any intrusiveness on the part of the author, but
because nobody has written about the same themes in the same way.” Mr. Hampson
is also master of the art-form of the short story; some of these have India for
their backcloth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

wind blows where it lists and the muse flows along the course it chooses for
itself and for a considerable proportion of our English-educated population the
real medium of expression, whether natural or not, whether We like it or not,

to divert all utterance into the mother-tongue will result in obvious
artificiality and insincerity or a drying up of the inspiration altogether.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

as Dr. K. Srinivasa Iyyengar justly observes, ‘Indo-Anglian poetry, to be
justified at all, must give us something which neither English poetry nor any
of our own regional literatures can give. It must learn to effect a true
marriage of Indian processes of poetic experience with English formulae of
verse expression.’ The true test of the validity of the use of a particular
language for poetic composition is the sincerity of the utterance and the
experience at the basis of the utterance. The sincerity of this rising poet in
his Passion as well as his Philosophy is unquestionable and the facility with
which he handles the ‘foreign’ language and its rhythm and metre, remarkable.
We wish the young author, Mr. Radhakrishnamurty, many years of fruitful

main thesis is, in the words of Sir C. P. Ramaswamy Aiyar, whose brilliant
foreword is another great attraction in the book ‘the need for <i>Swa-anubhava </i>by
which the creative artist expresses a decisive emotion and embodies his
conception of reality and of his search which is a search after the abiding
relations of life. Creative art is a kind of Yoga Sadhana, by which alone the
instinctive longings of man’s mind and soul can be translated into significance.
This Yoga can eliminate the barriers and limitations of existence and can
enable one to see unity in diversity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

book is divided into five sections with four appendices. The first section
gives a general outline of these Primitive tribes in ten chapters and treats of
the following points: – (1) the population of the various tribes according to
the 1941 census; (1) the reasons for choosing the name of Adimjati (Primitive
tribe) in preference to other names of Adi Basi, Vana Vasi, etc.. denying them
for the political or other stigma which they suggest; (3) the primitive
civilisation as the root of the present one; (4) the importance of the
languages of these tribes and their literatures chiefly comprising of song and
tale; (5) the dance systems of the several tribes; (6) their religious notions
and festivals; (7) systems of marriage; (8) a historical sketch of the part
played by these tribes in the freedom movement of India from the times of Maha
Rana Pratap.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

anthropologist and that of creating awakening in the tribes and bringing them
up to the level of Indian citizenship to which by constitution, India is

these tribes with special reference to the financial, educational, and health conditions
of these tribes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

fifth section gives in detail a historical sketch of the ameliorative measures
of various associations and bodies. It does not fail to make mention of the
services rendered by the Christian Missionaries for the reformation of these
tribes and describes at length the services of the various associations and
unions of workers, no less than a score in number, in addition to the
philanthropic activities of religious bodies such as the Ramakrishna Mission.
Next a brief note about each of the chief workers in the field is given of whom
(the late) Thakkar Bapa tops the list deservedly and to whom the book has been
rightly dedicated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

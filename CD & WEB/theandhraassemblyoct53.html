style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Andhra State was inaugurated on the 1st of October. If the 15th of August was
the birthday of Sri Aurobindo, the 1st October was the birthday of Dr. Annie
Besant. It is good to remind ourselves that Andhra was carved out as a distinct
Congress area in December 1917, at the Congress session in calcutta over which
Dr. Besant presided. The initial fight for the linguistic re-distribution of
India was fought almost single-handed by Dr. Patabhi Sitaramayya, till the
Lokamanya came to his rescue at a late stage of that memorable debate. But at
least an year earlier, Dr. Besant, as the founder of the Home Rule League,
accepted Dr. Pattabhi’s suggestion to make Andhra a self-contained unit for
organisational purposes. Sri G. Harisarvothama Rao was chosen as Secretary of
the Home Rule League for Andhra, and Desabhakta Konda Venkatappayya was the
first Secretary of Andhra Provincial Congress Committee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
this is now ancient history. After forty years of struggle, the Andhra State is
an accomplished fact. But the ship of State is sailing through rough seas. The
veteran leader of Andhra, Sri Prakasam, is at the helm and he is assisted by
men of ability and integrity like Sri Viswanatham and Sri Sanjiva Reddi. There is
an efficient Secretariat, intent on achieving great things. The legislature,
however, is a miscellaneous assortment of parties, groups, individuals–a
veritable arena of warring interests, without principles or policies. The very
first session revealed the dangers of group politics and divided loyalties. For
weeks ahead, the entire Telugu Press and some sections of the public carried on
a vociferous campaign for the shifting of the Capital from Kurnool to
Vijayawada-Guntur. The men of Rayalaseema did not control newspapers; they were
not adepts in the art of propaganda. But the younger men staged demonstrations
in the Capital, molested the legislators and burnt the newspaper parcels.
Orders under Section 144 had to be promulgated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the debate on the motion of thanks to the Governor for his address, conducted
in an atmosphere of strife and unreality, the Government were on the verge of a
defeat. Dame Rumour has it that information was passed on to the Chief Minister
from high quarters that, if any amendments to the address were carried, the
Government would have to resign. As a last-minute compromise, a non-official
day was allotted for the specific purpose of discussing the question of a
permanent Capital. Once again the flood of oratory was let loose, amendments to
the Congress-sponsored resolution were moved, debated and voted on, till
finally conclusions were reached, as in Goldsmith’s <i>Vicar, </i>in which
nothing was concluded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Chief Minieter’s official statement during the debate on the Governor’s address
was an admirable one, conceived in the best interests of the State and seeking
to reconcile different points of view. According to the Chief Minister, the
Capital was to continue in Kurnool for three years, at the end of which steps
would be taken to decide upon a permanent Capital. If, meanwhile, Visalandhra
with Hyderabad as its Capital did not materialise, the choice was to lie
between Waltair and Vijayawada-Guntur. It was not openly stated on the floor of
the Assembly that the High Court was to be located in Guntur from July 1954,
but it was well-known that the Government favoured this course. The mention of
Waltair as a possible alternative to Vijayawada-Guntur was the signal for an
outburst of anger, while the men of Kurnool wondered why Kurnool was not also
mentioned as a possible permanent Capital, in case Hyderabad was not available.
They were prepared to yield to the superior claims of Hyderabad and the
interests of Visalandhra, but they refused to concede that Vjaywada-Guntur was
a heaven compared to the hell of Kurnool, depicted with such vulgarity and
insolence in the writings and cartoons in the Telugu dailies. So, between the
conflicting groups, the Chief Minister’s statement and his appeal for unity
went unheeded. And the Andhra Legislature presented a spectacle which was, to
put it mildly, very unedifying.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
men of Andhra are intelligent, patriotic, and hard-working. As farmers and
weavers, their record of achievement is un-equalled. The poets and artists have
striven to uphold noble ideals; they have created things of great beauty. But
the political leadership is pitiful. Years ago, the antagonism between Sri
Prakasam and Dr. Pattabhi split up the political-minded sections of the Andhra
public into ‘Prakasam’s men’ and ‘Pattabhi’s men’. The General Elections in
Andhra in 1946 brought this schism to the fore. When Sri Prakasam became Chief
Minister, the presidentship of the Provincial Congress Committee became vacant.
</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>rival
groups gathered their forces at Chirala, and, with Sri Prakasam’s support, Sri
N. G. Ranga was elected President. This new </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>alignment introduced
another disturbing factor into Congress politics, and Sri Ranga, whose powers
of organisation are equaled only by his colossal vanity, imagined himself the
virtual dictator of Andhra politics.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Provincial Congress Committee and its subordinate organisations in the
Districts and Talukas became hot-beds of intrigue, and the perpetual squabbles
between the Ranga group and the Sanjiva Reddi group–the inheritors of the
Prakasam-Pattabhi feud–became a major headache for the Congress High Command.
At long last, the Provincial Congress Committee was dissolved, and after a
period of what may be described, by way of analogy, as rule under Section 93,
fresh elections were held. Once again a president had to be elected. Vijayawada
was the scene and the followers of Ranga and Sanjiva Reddi were drawn up like
the Kaurava and Pandava hosts. Sanjiva Reddi won by a narrow majority of 5, but
being a man of peace he offered to accommodate a number of Ranga’s men on his
Executive Committee, which was later to select the Congress candidates at the
General Elections of 1952. But Ranga would have none of it and, therefore,
Prakasam too would have none of it. They walked out of the Provincial Congress Committee
and formed a new Party–the Kisan Majdoor Praja Party–which affiliated itself to
the all-India Party of that name led by Acharya Kripalani. But Acharya
Kripalani ignored the all-India status of the Acharya from Andhra and failed to
nominate him to the Central Executive of the Party. He thought Prakasam was
enough. And so, in protest, Ranga formed yet another party–the Krishikar Lok
Party–which was also an all-India Party, but with no rival near the throne
which was Ranga’s by inherent right.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thus
the ‘official’ Congress led by Sanjiva Reddi, the K. M. P. of Sri Prakasam, and
the K. L. P. of Sri Ranga went before the electors, and poured forth their
vials of wrath. And they succeeded, by this process, in returning the
Communists in much larger numbers than the Communists ever hoped for. This was
the muddle into which erstwhile Congressmen led the Andhra country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
prospect was gloomy, and for a few days it looked as if Sri Prakasam and his
new-found allies, the Communists, would form a Ministry for the State of
Madras. But the advent of Sri Rajagopalachari on the scene changed the posture
of affairs, and there was a stable Government for Andhra and for the rest of
the Madras State till the 1st of October when the new State came into being. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the splitting up of parties into groups, and the emergence of ‘splinter’ groups
has gone on merrily. When the Socialist Party and the Kisan Majdoor Praja Party
effected a merger on an all-India basis, the K.M.P. in Andhra under Sri
Prakasam and Sri Viswanatham became the major section of the new
Praja-Socialist Party in Andhra. But there were half-a-dozen K. M. P. men who
stood aloof and functioned as a group. In the recent controversy over the
‘defection’ of Sri Prakasam from the Praja-Socialist Party, Viswanatham’s men
and the Raja of Vizianagaram’s men are breaking up into two rival groups, each
claiming to be the ‘official’ P. S. P. in the Assembly. The young Raja has
announced that Viswanatham ceased to be a member of the Party, while the
all-India Chief says, “No. Not yet.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the K. L. P. group itself, there are two sections–Thimma Reddi’s men and
Latchanna’s men. The members of the K. L. P. at one stage enrolled themselves
as associate members of the Congress Legislature Party. When the leader of the
Congress Party, Sri Sanjiva Reddi, sought election to the Legislative Assembly
of Madras from the Kalahasti Constituency in Chittoor District, Thimma Reddi
and one or two others worked strenuously for Sanjiva Reddi, while Latchanna’s
men acting under a party<i> </i>mandate openly canvassed against the Congress
Chief. The K. M. P. leaders, Prakasam and Viswanatham, though they were not
associate members, stood loyally by Sanjiva Reddi and went about the
constituency addressing meetings in support of him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>With
this background of strife, it was difficult even for a top ranking leader like
Sri Prakasam to form a stable Government. It was only the fear of the
Communists that brought various sections together. Till the midnight of
September 30, no one knew who were to be Ministers, though there were a few
‘certainties’ and a large number of ‘probabilities’. Sanjiva Reddi was opposed
to the inclusion of Latchanna and favoured Thimma Reddi, while Ranga insisted
on his inclusion, for he was the accredited representative of the K. L. P. Both
Thimma Reddi and Latchanna are now in the Cabinet, holding divergent views,
favouring divergent policies, and never knowing which way they should vote in a
division.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On
the question of the Capital, the part played by the K. L. P. has assumed queer
shapes. It was the K. L. P. that gathered the legislators of Rayalaseema at a
meeting in Gokhale Hall, Madras and got them to pass a resolution claiming the
Capital for themselves, and not the High Court, in terms of the Sri Bagh Pact.
And Tirupati was to be the favoured spot. Once the members of the Assembly from
Rayalaseema insisted on their rights under the Pact, Sri Prakasam and Sri
Sanjiva Reddi had to yield to their demand, if only to avoid a
Circars-Rayalaseema split over the formation of the new State. And they wisely
preferred Kurnool to Tirupati or any other place in Rayalaseema. But the K. L.
P. chiefs found the ground slipping from under their feet. There were powerful
interests in the Vijayawada-Guntur region which had to be placated, if the K.
L. P. was to face the electorate at the next General Election. So, they
switched round to Vijayawada-Guntur, and were more zealous in their advocacy
than even the Communists. After Latchanna came into the Cabinet, Sanjiva Reddi
and Latchanna made contradictory statements in the Press and on the platform
regarding the location of the Capital. People doubted if the Cabinet had a mind
of its own on important issues.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
happenings during the hectic week in Kurnool have convinced the Andhra public
that no progress is possible–no, not even normal efficient
administration–unless groups like the K. L. P. are dissolved. They are a danger
to our public life. If a parliamentary Government is to function successfully
in Andhra, these groups have to merge themselves in the Congress from which
they have seceded for personal and not ideological considerations, and allow
the country to choose between the Congress and the Communists. It must be a
straight fight between these two, in the Legislature as well as the country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

They have made stable administration an impossibility. Men who have watched
with pain and weariness of spirit the antics of these leaders should not be

“that is a cry of despair. We want the Andhra Government to establish
democratic rule, and enable Andhra to take its rightful place in the Indian
Union. The leaders must take heed before it is too late.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

regard to the resolution of the 30th of November, which favoured the choice of
Visakhapatnam (Waltair) as permanent Capital after 1st October 1956, the voting
was an example of political legerdemain. The amendment altering the date to the
1st of April 1956 was carried by a majority of only three, some members of the
amorphous groups remaining neutral. Then was carried an amendment in favour of
shifting the Government offices now in Madras to Vijayawada-Guntur within six
months. This amendment ought to have been excluded by the Speaker when lots
were drawn to decide priority. It related to a matter of administrative detail,
and had no relation to the main issue of the location of the permanent Capital,
which was to form the sole subject of discussion on the 30th. Having admitted
it, he could not refuse to let the House divide on it. But even with this
amendment, the main resolution ought to have been passed by the Assembly. There
was no inherent contradiction between it and the amendment carried earlier. The
Capital could remain at Kurnool till April 1956, and shifted to Visakhapatnam
(Waltair) after that date. And yet, the offices in Madras might be shifted to
Vijayawada-Guntur almost immediately. The failure to pass the resolution as
amended left the House without any substantive proposition before it–a
situation rather unusual in parliamentary history!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

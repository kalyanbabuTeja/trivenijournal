style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
<span class=SpellE>Zamindar</span> had decided to add another floor to his
house, and to have a new wing projected from the eastern block for his son who
was to be married. He called a building contractor and gave him four months
time to complete the job. The contractor, who was a tenant in the <span
class=SpellE>Zamindar’s</span> estate, knew that what the <span class=SpellE>Zamindar</span>
demanded he would have, and if he failed to get the work done within the
allotted time he would get no work again. So he recruited extra <span
class=SpellE>labour</span> and asked the brick-maker, <span class=SpellE>Kamal</span>,
to put extra time and energy into his work so that the supply of bricks did not
fail. The brick kiln was not far from the <span class=SpellE>Zamindar’s</span>
house and the way to it from the village in which <span class=SpellE>Kamal</span>
lived passed close to the house. <span class=SpellE>Kamal</span> and his wife,
with others worked over-time. Late in the evening as they went home by the side
of the <span class=SpellE>Zamindar’s</span> house they watched the rising new
construction in which the bricks made by them were used. They were proud. “We
have to work harder to make more bricks to make the house big,” said <span
class=SpellE>Kamal’s</span> wife. “Yes,” said <span class=SpellE>Kamal</span>
“and the house <span class=GramE>has</span> to be finished before the marriage.
We shall start earlier tomorrow morning.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

afternoon it rained but <span class=SpellE>Kamal</span> and his wife went on
making clay and filling the moulds for the kiln. They got wet but continued
till evening. Their scanty clothes were all wet; water dripped from their head.
When passing by the side of the <span class=SpellE>Zamindar’s</span> house they
saw the new constructions going up and the pile of bricks made by their hands
around them. They were pleased. A strong wind now blew across their face and
brought heavy rain. They halted and took shelter under a tree opposite the gate
of the <span class=SpellE>Zamindar’s</span> house. More strongly the wind blew
and they shivered in their wet clothes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

car, and his wife and son. The son was driving. He was to be married and for
him the new wing was being constructed. They all saw <span class=SpellE>Kamal</span>
and his wife standing wet under the tree. The <span class=SpellE>Zamindar</span>
called the <span class=SpellE>Darwan</span> and asked him who the man and the

was his first purchase of a lottery ticket. Since the day he purchased it <span
class=SpellE>Motilal</span> has been restless. He has been sitting for some
extra time, both in the morning and in the evening, for <span class=SpellE>Puja</span>
and prayer. He also daily visited the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">temple</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on"><span
  class=SpellE>Luxmi</span></st1:PlaceName></st1:place> and offered the Deity
more flowers and more coins than before. As the date of the draw of the lottery
advanced his mental agitation increased, and so also increased the time of his <span
class=SpellE>Puja</span> and the time he stood with folded hands before the
Deity in the temple. There was evident <span class=SpellE>fervour</span> in his
devotion and pathetic appeal in his eyes when he stood facing the Deity in the
temple. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was Monday. The next was the day of the draw. He had disturbed sleep in the
night, but got up very early to go to the <st1:place w:st="on">Ganges</st1:place>
for bath. There he found some <span class=SpellE>neighbours</span> who, like
him, did not usually go to the <st1:place w:st="on">Ganges</st1:place> for
bath. He wondered if they also had purchased tickets of the same lottery. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

down and taking three dips in the holy water he stood with folded hands facing
the Sun and prayed softly for giving him luck the next day. As he said his
prayer again and again with rising <span class=SpellE>ardour</span> and emotion
he heard others standing by his side with folded hands saying similar prayers.
His mind was diverted to them and he felt uncertain about his chances in the
lottery. “They are all praying. Whom will God <span class=SpellE>favour</span>?”

was worried, and lost the mood to pray. Coming out of the water he hurried to
the temple, carrying more flowers, fruits and sweets than ever. He asked the <span
class=SpellE>Pujari</span> to do special <span class=SpellE>Puja</span> on his
behalf. The <span class=SpellE>Pujari</span> arranged and started. Shortly
after, those who had stood by his side in the <st1:place w:st="on">Ganges</st1:place>
and prayed arrived, with many offerings in their hands for <span class=SpellE>Puja</span>.
Each asked the <span class=SpellE>Pujari</span> to arrange and do special <span
class=SpellE>Puja</span> for his luck in the lottery. The <span class=SpellE>Pujari</span>
nodded his head and hurried through the <span class=SpellE>Puja</span> he was
doing for <span class=SpellE>Motilal</span>. <span class=SpellE>Motilal</span>
was more worried as he watched the impatience of the <span class=SpellE>Pujari</span>
to start <span class=SpellE>Puja</span> for them, and also as he noticed that
they had brought more flowers and offerings for the <span class=SpellE>Puja</span>.
He became nervous and feared that <span class=SpellE>Luxmi's</span> <span
class=SpellE>favour</span> would go to them. Quickly he took out a five rupee
note from his pocket and asked the <span class=SpellE>Pujari</span> to place it
at the feet of <span class=SpellE>Luxmi</span>. But to his dismay he saw that
one of those who were waiting for the <span class=SpellE>Pujari</span> to be
free had ten rupees in his hand and another had twenty. The <span class=SpellE>Pujari</span>
finished and <span class=SpellE>Motilal</span> had to make room for others. He
went home sad, despairing of winning the three <span class=SpellE>lacs</span>
which he had hoped to win. “Others have offered more and their chances will
accordingly be greater” he reflected, but yet he kept praying. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

felt no need, no want, but found plenty at home. The food he ate tasted well
again, and the sleep in the night he had was so soothing and deep. He recovered
the peace, contentment and happiness which he had lost. His Deity had given him
more than he had asked for, more, much more than the three <span class=SpellE>lacs</span>
that the lottery ticket could have brought. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

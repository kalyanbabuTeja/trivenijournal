style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When,
as in our time, public events tend to invade and </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>swamp private
lives, the sensitive artist is beset with two opposite kinds of temptation. He
is impelled either to devote his </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Imaginative powers, to
the creation of a special world in which he can enjoy sentimental compensations
for the frustrations engendered in him by an unsympathetic or hostile
environment, or to regard himself as a kind of prophet, an ‘unacknowledged
legislator of mankind’, whose function and destiny it is to remould the real
world, by the incantation of his words, into another nearer to his heart’s
desire. Should he succumb, he becomes a ‘romantic escapist’ or a political
propagandist. In either case, he abandons his legitimate and unique role viz.,
to translate the materialistic, external world we all project round ourselves
by the exercise of our will, back into the language of imagination and dream,
to reveal, in other words, external actuality as symbolic inner consciousness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
fulfill this function consistently is, however, certainly no easy task in the
present circumstances. So distressing is experience, so hostile is contemporary
life to the preservation of tranquil detachment and impersonal receptivity, so
petrified, overwhelming an</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

font-family:"Times New Roman"'>d whole, melt it with his imagination into its
symbolic aspects and create its order. Besides being endowed with a
comprehensive imagination and indomitable courage, he must be capable of
devising techniques, subtle and flexible enough to focus the variegated
material of modern existence into a significant pattern, to juxtapose past
culture with present civilisation and fuse together disparate experiences of
the poetical and the commonplace, the sordid and the sublime, the bestial and
the spiritual. If his work to adequately interpret the modern mind he must also
be able to utilise imagery drawn from science and technology and, above all, to
convey extremely elusive and complex states of consciousness and acute
sensibility. In the circumstances, it is not surprising that, despite the
phenomenal increase of literary activity in the past few years, there has been
comparatively little creative achievement of the first order.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
assert, therefore, that the hundred and odd stories that Prof. Gangadhar Gadgil
has so far published constitute a body </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of work of more than
ordinary significance is no mean tribute to this young writer. His talents are
indeed versatile. A professor of Economics in the sydenham College of Commerce
and Economics, Bombay, he has already published two works on the Principles of
Economics and Monetary Theory. He has discoursed widely on public platforms on
a variety of topics, literary, social and economic. He has written a
travel-book and earned a name as one of the most vigorous controversialists in
the world of Marathi journalism. But, notwithstanding this wide range of his
activities and achievements. Prof. Gadgil is first and foremost a story-teller.
The best of his talents has entered into his stories, and it is by them that he
must be judged.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Manasa
Chitre’ (pictures of the Mind)–the title of the first collection of Prof.
Gadgil’s stories, may, if understood in its proper connotation, serve as a
generic title to virtually all his stories; for, in effect they are all
attempts to interpret the intricate and complex mental operations, conscious
and subconscious, of ordinary men and women enmeshed in the toils of the
contemporary environment. A strange, unappeasable curiosity seems to haunt the
mind of this writer, like a restless demon, eternally urging it to probe into
the innermost depths and recesses of men’s minds, to trace every variety of
their activity back to its motives, and these motives again to subconscious
impulses and complexes. These impulses and complexes themselves are often found
to spring from the environment, so that men and women are revealed to be
creatures of a world which their own voluntary and involuntary acts have
contributed to create. They are self-deluded victims of an order which they
themselves have brought into being without wholly realising what they were
doing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is this profound penetration into the springs of human action and behaviour
that gives Prof. Gadgil’s stories their </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>distinctive character.
What distinguishes him from the majority of literary aspirants is, above all,
the fact that he is interested not so much in the significance of things and
events as in the moments when men become aware of them. In his pages, the
external world is made vivid by the description of the state of mind in which
it is perceived. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is not, therefore, presumptuous to claim for Prof. Gadgil what can be claimed
for so few writers, viz., that the tendency of his work is to extend the
material of literature and, at the same time, to clarify the processes whereby
the outside world becomes the inner world within the individual. On the whole,
the result of his writing is to direct the literary sensibility inwards. It is
as though, in extending the material of literature, he had made the external
world an object of interior sensibility, as though he had cast away the husk of
its outwardness in attempting to digest it in his mind. In any case, the
direction of Prof. Gadgil’s imaginative effort is in tune with the spirit of an
age that has well-nigh abolished the distinction between matter and mind and
whose tortured self-consciousness has invented psycho-analysis.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But,
fortunately, Prof. Gadgil’s passion for X-raying the mind and unearthing its
hidden secrets is rigorously controlled by his artistic instincts, so that the
stories never assume the character of psycho-analytical documents or the
pathologist’s records of ‘cases’. The impression they leave on the mind is
rather that of a spell of orchestral music in which manifold subtle and
evanescent notes contrast, shade off, and blend to evoke a complex and
satisfying harmony. Prof. Gadgil attempts to produce on the reader’s mind a
complicated pattern of artistic effects, fusing together inter-related and
contrasted modes of emotional experience in a single story, as the musician
fuses various notes to produce a complex melody. A typical Gadgil story is a
symphony of variegated emotional tones.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now,
no writer with any knowledge of his craft would venture lightly to adopt such a
complicated technique. It is admittedly new and its successful handling demands
extraordinary sensitiveness and delicacy on the part of the artist. When it
fails, it fails disastrously. If, despite this danger, Prof. Gadgil has adopted
it, it is because nothing else could serve his purpose. The conventional
pattern of fictional writing with its formal “exposition, complication, climax
a</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>nd resolution”, and all the paraphernalia of ornaments and
background descriptions, was too crude and artificial to convey, with the
requisite subtlety and precision, the form and </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>pressure of his
thought and emotional reactions to the world around him. For, when he looked
around him, what he saw was the immense and chaotic panorama of a
disintegrating and aimless society which, having lost the springs of its
vitality, had become as incapable of creative experimentation and progress as a
fossil. Religious sanctions had withered, and no other self-transcending ideals
commanding spontaneous and widespread acceptance had taken their place. Cut off
from the moorings of a living tradition by the advancing tides of science and
technology that had invaded every department of his life, modern man found himself
drifting without chart or compass, guided by no impulses other than those of
self-interest, fear and greed. Dominated by the self-regarding restlessness, a
victim of eternal suspicions, anxieties and day-dreams. His mind worked
incoherently, and his life was no more than a matter of disjointed,
hand-to-mouth existence. Though he was seldom left to himself, he suffered from
a sense of isolation and loneliness and carved for understanding and sympathy.
Constantly distracted by the innumerable claims made by the routine of
civilised existence on his attention, he had little time (and less patience)
for contemplation and self-discipline; so that he understood neither himself
nor the society in which he lived. As a result, he was repeatedly confronted with
situations he had not anticipated and provided for; he was constantly
bewildered by the irrational urges arising from the unexplored depths of his
own being and the unfeeling or hostile reactions of the world to his desperate
endeavours to satisfy them. He struggled incessantly, but vainly, to establish
some kind of harmony between his thoughts and his deeds, and between himself
and his environment. In this struggle he deceived others and often deceived
himself. The struggle was essentially tragic, but it had its comic side. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
portray this tragi-comic drama of contemporary civilised life in imaginative
terms, to bring it home to his readers in all its range and complexity and with
all its emotional nuances and overtones,–that was what Prof. Gadgil found he
had to undertake. The undertaking, however, offered a difficult technical
problem, for what in effect he had to do was to organise into a pattern (for
that is the soul of art) modes of consciousness and experience whose
distinguishing character was a 1ack of organising principle the absence of any
inherent direction. He solved the problem in the only way it was possible to
solve it, viz., by devising technique analogous to that of the musician. This
technique gave him freedom from the tyranny of the cramping conventions of
orthodox fiction and enabled him to bring together widely disparate thoughts
and feelings to illuminate his meaning. He could introduce counter-point,
repeat and complicate emotional effect and invest insignificant details with a
startling significance. Above all, he could suggest the similarity that often
lies underneath </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>contrasting appearances and could stress the
essential equivalent of seemingly different experiences. He could thus tacitly
reveal the sameness as well as the contrasts between the past and the present,
and between individuals living in different worlds at the same time, without
intruding himself upon the reader.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
effectiveness of his technique has been demonstrated by Prof. Gadgil in story
after story. The tale called ‘The Froth and the dregs’ is as good an example as
any. The hero of this story is a typical middle-aged intellectual, one of the
finest flowers as well as the ornament of our self-regarding and complacent
‘high’ society. Like many other members of this petrified class, he regards
himself as a disinterested social worker; but, in truth, his multifarious
social activities–which range from lecturing to women’s societies to writing
letters to the ‘Times of India’–are actuated by no other motive than that of
personal advancement and self-agrandisement. Though shrewd, well-intentioned
and courageous, he has no real understanding of the revolutionary forces that
agitate underneath the deceptively tranquil crust of our social existence. This
is indeed not wholly his fault. This limitation of vision is an inherent
characteristic of a class which, in isolating itself from the mass of the
people, has condemned itself to a life of meaningless activity and glittering
illusions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
story opens with a brief cinematographic glimpse of Prof. Deshpande at his job.
He had lectured for twenty-five years and now he is at it again. When a crow
enters the lecture-room, Prof. Deshpande coolly removes his spectacles from his
eyes and cuts a joke. There is an outburst of laughter from his juvenile
audience, and Prof. Deshpande is flattered by the success of his jest. But
while returning to the Common Room after concluding his lecture, he is struck
by the humiliating doubt that perhaps the laughter of his students was derisive
rather than appreciative. Dominated by the conviction of his own wisdom and the
absolute rightness of his scale of values, Prof. Deshpande was not ordinarily
given to doubts and inner conflicts. It was in fact only recently, particularly
since 1942 that he was being frequently confronted with situations that baffled
his acute intelligence and caused him serious anxiety. The techniques he had
hitherto successfully employed for overcoming social tensions and conflicts,
e.g., forming committees, framing cleverly-worded resolutions, and reconciling
opponents with the soothing balm of honied words–these did not somehow work in
the new situations. Reason and argument and persuasive eloquence were
unsatisfactory instruments for dealing with problems that had their roots in
the irrational urges of men. How could, for example, reason and argument help
him when his wife regarded him as guilty and incessantly nagged him because his
only daughter–an M.A.–had chosen to desert her duly wedded husband and had
returned to live with her parents? Argument with his wife was as futile as
argument with his servant who had latterly proved grossly negligent and
insolent and seemed to meet all his remonstrances with a derisive smile.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
clear outlines in which the world had presented itself to Prof. Deshpande were
now getting blurred. Ironically enough, at this very moment of anxious
bewilderment, somebody accidentally knocks off his spectacles from his eyes,
and the glasses are broken. Now, the physical world appears as confused to his
vision as the moral order. Things suddenly seem to lose their distinctness and
opacity and become hazy and translucent; he loses his sense of distance and
cannot distinguish trams from buses and friends from strangers; and he begins
to be harassed by the feeling that the atmosphere he breathed was filled with
an infinite number of minute living germs. When a young colleague tries to
persuade him that perhaps his purblind apprehension of the world at that moment
was truer than that of the ordinary man’s, and that the impression of distinct
identities that our senses convey to us may after all be illusory, Prof.
Deshpande’s irritation knows no bounds. Such unorthodox notions were repugnant
to the very fundamental axioms on which he had founded the formidable edifice
of his </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>entire life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
a ruder shock awaited this magnificent structure close at hand. Soon after he
gets his glasses refitted, Prof. Deshpande finds the hitherto crowded streets
suddenly being deserted, and panic-stricken men and women running helter-skelter
to the safety of their homes. Prof. Deshpande is mystified, but the enquiries
he addresses to a couple of men in the street elicit no response. The men look
at him wildly for a moment and hurry away. In the end, he comes across the
poster that shatters once for all the insulated universe of his consciousness.
For Mahatma Gandhi had been murdered and anew, fearful force had been released
in the body social. There was none who could prophecy what havoc it might
perpetrate in the first flush of its liberation. Prof. Deshpande feels that,
like himself, Mother India had lost her spectacles and nothing in existence
would henceforth be intelligible and familiar to him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Overwhelmed
by a feeling of utter helplessness, Prof. Deshpande returns home and tries to
rest. He could think of no clever arguments or committees or resolutions to aid
him at this </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>supreme crisis of his life. He could, in fact,

curiously enough, another mind surprisingly similar to Prof. Deshpande’s,
though operating on a different level of society, was stimulated by this very
occasion to extraordinary activity. The leader of the Bombay Mawalis, whose
talents and achievement had earned for him in the underworld a reputation as
great as Prof. Deshpande’s in the <i>beau monic</i>, quickly realises that the
shock which had temporarily weakened the normal sanctions of society provided
him with an excellent opportunity to carry out his cherished designs against
its security. He could not, he knew, successfully wage war against the whole
social order. But, surely, </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

due course, the Dada breaks into Prof. Deshpande’s house with his gang. The
froth and the dregs of society confront each other. By force of a habit which
had become second nature with him, Prof. Deshpande is impelled to meet the
situation with his weapon of sweet reasonableness. He tries to persuade the
Dada that he was no Hindu-Mahasabhite and did not believe in mixing up religion
and politics. When, in a moment, he realises what a colossal folly it was to
argue with such an adversary in such terms, he stands in silence to face what
was coming. He could think of no other response that was appropriate to the
situation. He is hit and collapses to the ground. When, however, the gang proceed
to attack his wife and rob her of her ornaments, it is his daughter who saves
the situation by courageously confronting the marauders with a show of physical
resistance, which they understood better than Prof. Deshpande’s reasoned
eloquence. The gang is temporarily cowed by her fearlessness and, before they r</span><span

groping for his spectacles. Whether h</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

story is an outstanding illustration of the extraordinary complexity and
richness of effects that Prof. Gadgil is able to coalesce within the compass of
a story running into hardly a dozen pages. The most conspicuous characteristic
of his art is </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>indeed its austere economy. Even the most
trivial details mentioned with apparent casualness in the course of the story
assume, as we proceed with it, an overwhelming symbolic significance. For
example, the unreality of the glittering world in which the professor had dwelt
all his life is symbolised by his pathetic dependence on his spectacles, and
the breaking of the spectacles signifies the break-up of that world. Similarly,
the subsidiary characters, besides living in their own right, also constitute a
hall of mirrors revealing, each in a different way, the woeful inadequacy of
the professor’s philosophy of life. The young colleague who tells him that
there is nothing like “cause and effect” in the universe,–there are only
“functional relationships”; the daughter who realises the essential vulgarity
of the social parasite, whether his methods are technically lawful (like the
professor) or openly violent; and the Dada who rules society in crisis as the
professor has ruled it in security–all these represent vital elements in the
modern consciousness, to whose existence he has been blind. Since, like the
professor, allot us, by the very limitations of human nature, tend to create
for ourselves an artificial world abstracted from reality, and to regard it as
the real world, the professor’s tragedy assumes in our mind the character of an
awful symbol of universal human.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
structure of the story is also characteristic of Prof. Gadgil. For what he does
in this and a majority of his other stories is, to open with a vivid, dramatic
presentation of a character playing his accustomed part in the narrow world of
his routine existence, and then demonstrate his pathetic helplessness in the
face of a situation which, though arising naturally from the conditions of
contemporary existence, takes him by surprise. If the reader does not
sympathise with the individual character, the struggles of that character, overtaken
by the unexpected, would strike him as comic and even contemptible. If, on the
other hand, he does sympathise, he might be disposed to accept the character as
a tragic victim of an ill-organized society. He might even be moved to
indignation by this revelation of society’s callousness towards the claims of
the individual. But the author himself refuses to take sides, either on behalf
of the individual or the society. He simply exposes, with the exquisite
delicacy of a masterly technique, the subtle and manifold tissues of
inter-relationship between the individual and the social order and the
suffering which ensues from their maladjustment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>From
the standpoint of the literary critic, however, the significance of Prof.
Gadgil’s work lies in the technique adopted for this exposure rather than in
the exposure itself. The technique is impressionistic rather than photographic,
and depends for its effects on suggestion rather than on realistic description.
It is by his deft manipulation of suggestive symbols that Prof. Gadgil
illuminates the human significance of complex social processes, reveals
identities and contrasts between apparently disconnected experiences and
situations, and attains his highly evocative artistic eff</span><span

is to say, despite its appearance of aggressive realism and disillusionment,
the core of Prof. Gadgil’s work is un-mistakably poetic. His ruthless and
corrosive analysis of the social anomalies and contradictions of a decadent,
disintegrating civilisation, and the pitifully inadequate and disjointed lives
of the human types it breeds, implies the vision of an order of existence more
in tune with the instinctive needs and urges of the human personality. Some of
his stories indeed read like records exquisite day-dreams in which the author’s
sensitive mind has occas</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Gadgil’s earlier work has been controlled–not eliminated–by the innate sanity
of his temperament, the rigorous discipline in self-detachment to which he has
subjected himself and, above all, by his sense of humour. The result is that
his work, at its best, has acquired that unique, though elusive, flavour which,
only a rare blend of poetry and humour can endow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

his contemporaries it would seem that Prof. Gadgil’s most signal service has
been to reveal the age to itself with insight and courage. He has seen the
conditions of modern life with unwavering eyes and interpreted the intricate
and often baffling relationships that determine its pattern. He has exposed the
weaknesses in its structure and the disparities and injustices it generates.
Above all he has shown how individuals, estimable in themselves but unable to
respond to its rapidly changing demands, are condemned to humiliating
frustrations and impotence. The effect of his work therefore is, like that of
all great art, to enrich our understanding of ourselves and to enlarge our
social sympathies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

what of the future? None can predict with any degree of certainty in what
direction an imaginative writer’s spiritual explorations will take him or what
his ultimate destiny is likely to be. But one thing seems certain. Even if
Prof. Gadgil were henceforward not to write a single line, his place in the
galaxy of Indian writers is assured. Even when all the torments and moral
conflicts that now afflict us have disappeared and the present pattern of
society itself has given place to a better organized one, Prof. Gadgil will
still be remembered as one who contributed not a little towards the renovation

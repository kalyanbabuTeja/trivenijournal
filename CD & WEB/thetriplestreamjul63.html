in a moment. It is this fear of extinction on a vast scale, which has so far
prevented the declaration of a war in which nuclear weapons play a leading
role. But even short of war, the tests by the rival powers pollute the
atmosphere and spread disease and destruction, though </span><span

a suffering humanity except a fervent appeal to the better instincts of the
offenders. These are swayed by mutual fear and suspicion, and are averse to
taking unilateral action abandoning all nuclear tests. It is now a matter for

practice of the supreme virtues of love, kindliness and sympathy. And in this
context, a recovery of faith in human values as expressed through art,

ideal gobd of all mankind. As a necessary preliminary to the creation of a

controversies of recent years between important States like <st1:City w:st="on">Mysore</st1:City>,
<st1:place w:st="on">Maharashtra</st1:place> and Andhra Pradesh have impeded
the progress of schemes, the implementation of which was of vital importance to
the whole country. If agricultural production was to be increased and the
growth of industries fostered, irrigation electric projects on a vast scale
were needed. The waters of rivers like the Godavari and the <st1:place w:st="on">Krishna</st1:place>
had to be harnessed for the purpose. But when the 1951 agreement on the sharing
of the waters of these rivers was challenged and the<span style="mso-spacerun:

the allotment to the different States, a situation arose which was likely to
lead to the indefinite postponement of all claims, present or future. The
Commission sought to estimate the quantity of water available for sharing, but
this was a complicated process and no final estimate could be made. Meanwhile,
the States were claimant and urged that projects already undertaken or awaiting
final sanction should be proceeded with. This argument appealed to the Central
Government, and, on their behalf, the former Minister Irrigation, Hafiz
Ibrahim, gave what was virtually an interim </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

laid the corner-stones of two important projects, Srisailam on the Krishna and

theory, the rivers of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
belong to the entire nation, and every State is entitled to profit from their
waters. Indeed a day may come when the rivers all over <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
are in connected, and their waters made to serve the interests of regions far
beyond the States of their origin or flow. But even before that day dawns, it
may be possible to divert the waters of the Godavari into the <st1:place w:st="on">Krishna</st1:place>,
as suggested by the Gullhati Commission. Whether such diversion is feasible in
the near future is a problem which, along with other problems arising out of
the Central Government’s present award, has to be tackled by the new Irrigation
Minister, Dr. K. L. Rao, who is noted for his wide knowledge and experience as
a front-rank engineer. One important consideration emphasised by the Prime
Minister is the ability of the different States to make the best use of their
store of the waters in the immediate future. It is not fair to hold up
present-day schemes capable of achieving quick results, with a view to
accommodating possible future projects which may not materialise for several
decades. It is also believed that after detailed investigations carried on for
some years, it may be found possible to sanction several of the projects which
the States have in view. The effort always must utilise the waters or Indian
rivers to the maximum extent without allowing them to run waste to the sea. At
present only a fraction of the available water is being used. With the passage
of time and the starting of new projects under the guidance of a well-equipped
and impartial Central Board, all parts of the country will share in the
progressive use of our river waters. It is unreasoning suspicion which causes
endless wrangler; and every State presents a list of projects which may not
ultimately serve the needs of the nation. It is not merely more projects, and
yet more of them, that we need, but the skilful planning of all river projects,
keeping in view their contribution to the agricultural and industrial progress
of the nation, There must also be some kind of finality to decisions reached,
frequent deviations due to political pressures. The state of uncertainty which
prevailed till recently is fraught with danger to all schemes of expansion.</span><span

<h2>The Vision of Krishnaswami Aiyar </h2>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
late V. Krishnaswami Aiyar, whose birth-centenary was celebrated on the 15th of
June, was eminent as a lawyer and statesman, scholar and philanthropist. There
was something unique about him. It was his vision which illumined his entire
life and gave it a meaning and a purpose. He came at a crisis in our nation’s
history, when old values were being questioned, and the foundations of Indian
life undermined. As he grew up, he sensed the new life that men like Sri
Ramakrishna and Vivekananda, Naoroji and Ranade, poured forth in abundance. He
saw a new <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in the making, and himself contributed to that making. That new India was,
doubtless, to be free politically, but political freedom was but an outward,
tangible expression of that inner freedom of the mind and the spirit, which
could not be won until we grasped the significance of the long ages of Indian
culture and achievement, in art and literature, in social organisation and
religious quest. A whole generation, or even two, had been cut off from this
fount of life; and so, in the process of raising the edifice of a new <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
the revival and re-interpretation of ancient Indian culture in varied domains,
was an essential need. If Krishnaswami Aiyar was a friend of Vivekananda and
Baba Bharati, if he looked upon Malaviya and Gokhale on his own brothers, if he
welcomed Subrahmania Bharati, the poet, and Sambanda Mudaliar, the playwright,
if he edited the <i>Arya Charitam </i>and encouraged the recitation of the
Gita, it was entirely because he perceived, in the effulgence of his intuition,
that all this was an offering at the feet of the Mother, who after a temporary
eclipse was becoming ever more real to a whole people. His fundamental faith
was that the custodians of this great Culture–the Vedic scholars, the masters
of the Sastras and Kavyas<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>must be sought
out and provision made for the continuity of the stream of national culture.
Thus he founded The Mylapore Sanskrit college. Thus too he founded the sister
institutions, the Ayurvedic college and the Venkataramana Dispensary, for the
preservation and growth of the science of healing which the Rishis left us as a
precious legacy. And then, having the gifts of a statesman, he was resolved,
for the honour of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
to prove that Indians could shape high policy and administer Departments of
State. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

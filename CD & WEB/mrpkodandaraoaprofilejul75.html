away peacefully at the ripe of 86 in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span
  class=SpellE>Bangalore</span></st1:place></st1:City>, was one of the few and
fast dwindling band of <span class=SpellE>sauave</span>, scholarly and
dedicated ‘soldiers of national righteousness’ of the earlier generation, who
unostentatiously fought for social, political and educational reform. They
always did what duty and <span class=SpellE>honour</span> required, and were
admired for their integrity, both in the official and private lives. They were
like so many lodestars that indicated direction to ‘many a wandering <span

in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Visakhapatnam</span></st1:place></st1:City>
in 1889 in affluent circumstances, he developed early in life a liberal
outlook, self-reliance and a passion to serve our motherland. In his school
days he happened to read some of the speeches of<i> </i>Swami <span
class=SpellE>Vivekananda</span> and was impressed profoundly by the inspiring
episode in which the Swami, when asked by some memorable <span class=SpellE>Pandits</span>
to adduce authority for one of his statements, replied that he was himself its
authority. This episode fostered in Mr. <span class=SpellE>Rao</span>
self-reliance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
<span class=SpellE>Rao</span> went up to <st1:City w:st="on">Madras</st1:City>
for his higher studies and took his B.A. (<span class=SpellE>Hons</span>.) and
M.A. (<span class=SpellE>Hons</span>.) degrees from the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Madras</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
in 1915 and 1917 respectively. An important event during his student days in <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City> determined the
course of his life. Mr. <span class=SpellE>Gokhale</span> delivered in 1913 a
public lecture in which he made a fervent appeal to Indian graduates to give up
the ordinary ambitions a life and dedicate themselves to ‘<span class=SpellE>spiritualising</span>’
the public life of India. Mr. <span class=SpellE>Rao</span> immediately
registered a secret vow to join servants of India Society of which Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Gokhale</span> was then the president. True to his vow he went
immediately after his graduation to the Rt. <span class=SpellE>Hon’ble</span> <span
class=SpellE>Srinivasa</span> <span class=SpellE>Sastri</span>, who by then
succeeded Mr. <span class=SpellE>Gokhale</span> as the Society’s President,
seeking admission into the society. With fatherly concern Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Sastri</span> informed the young supplicant that he was too fresh
from the college to take such a life-long step and that, as he had nothing yet
to lose, advised him to make good elsewhere for some years and then return to
him. Accordingly Mr. <span class=SpellE>Rao</span> joined the Central-College, <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Bangalore</span></st1:place></st1:City>,
in 1915 </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>as lecturer in Botany and served the college for
six years. <span class=GramE>When in 1921 he desired to give up his job, Dr <span
class=SpellE>Brajendranath</span> Seal, Vice-Chancellor of the <st1:PlaceName
w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Mysore</span></st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType>, assured him that one could serve <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> as well
through the university as through the Servants of India Society, and held up
bright prospects for the young man.</span> However, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Rao</span>
pleaded with Dr Seal to let him go in view of his ‘secret and binding’ vow. After
some stringent testing, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Sastri</span> admitted him in
the Society, and for ten long yeas thereafter, he served Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Sastri</span> as his personal secretary in India, England and
Africa, specially when the latter was a member of the Indian <span
class=SpellE>Councel</span> of State, of the Indian Round Table Conference,
London, and of the two Round Table Conferences between India and South Africa
in Cape Town, and again when Mr. <span class=SpellE>Sastri</span> was
Agent-General of the Government of India in South Africa. Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Rao</span> enjoyed his master’s confident and was bound to him, as
Mr. <span class=SpellE>Sastri</span> put it, “by the close ties of an affection
that nothing can dim and many dear memories of journeys, anxieties, trials and
enjoyments in common.’ No wonder he adored Mr. <span class=SpellE>Sastri</span>,
this side idolatry. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Under
Mr. <span class=SpellE>Sastri’s</span> astute tutelage, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Rao</span>
developed an uncanny grasp of the subtle ties of international affairs and
participated in a number of international seminars and colloquia. He spent <span
class=GramE>an</span> year (1934-35) as <span class=SpellE>Cornegie</span>
Scholar making a special study of race relations at the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Yale</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.
He stated that his study of the influence of Western civilization on the
Eastern at Yale convinced him that the traditional division of civilization
into Eastern and Western had no rational foundation. A seminar which he
attended in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Honolulu</st1:place></st1:City>
in 1936 gave a happy turn to the course of his bachelor life. Mr. Arthur Mayhew
made a scathing criticism of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
at the seminar. Hurt by the ill-informed and vile criticism of Mr. Mayhew, Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Rao</span> sought permission to suitable reply, but permission to
do so was bluntly refused much to the chagrin and disappointment of Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Rao</span>, Miss Mary Louise Campbell, a teacher from Ohio taking
some summer courses at the University of Hawaii, then came upon him as an angel
of mercy and offered him sympathy and moral support. This lissome American lady
was destined to become later Mr. <span class=SpellE>Rao’s</span> life-partner.
Brushing aside Mr. <span class=SpellE>Rao’s</span> strong objections that he
was not a Raja, although with his gold-laced turban he looked like one, that
she would be virtually in exile if she married him and that she would have to
do all household chores herself as he could not afford even </span><span

sweeper, she came to India on a ‘honey-silent’ day in 1937 and married him
cheerfully in Poona. She had been his constant companion ever since, making him
grow into a world citizen, enabling him to live, by her thrift, trust and
devotion, “a champagne life on a beer income.” As a matter of fact, Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Rao</span> </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>admitted that their lives had roses, roses

their apprecia</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It is noteworthy that in marrying Mary, he followed
one of the important tenets of the Servants of India Society. In an
autobiographical radio talk he observed with legitimate pride: </p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
of the solemn vows which were administered to me when I joined the Servants of
India Society was that I would regard all Indians as brothers and without
distinction of caste or creed. As the most effective implementation of the
policy, I have all along advocated inter-caste, inter-racial and international
marriages to promote national and international integration, and <span
class=SpellE>practised</span> it. My marriage is inter-racial, international,
inter-religious and casteless.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
were three distinctive features which marked the illustrious life of Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Kodanda</span> <span class=SpellE>Rao</span>: his abiding trust in
friends, his deep love of intellectuals and men of letters, and his compassion
towards dumb animals. He was fortunate in his rich and varied associations, and
he could count among his friends intellectuals like Dr S. <span class=SpellE>Radhakrishnan</span>
and Professor Ross, administrators like Sir <span class=SpellE>Mirza</span> <span
class=SpellE>Ismail</span> and Sir C. P. <span class=SpellE>Ramaswami</span> <span
class=SpellE>Aiyar</span>, and men of letters like Dr D. V. <span class=SpellE>Gundappa</span>
and ‘<span class=SpellE>Vighneswara</span>’ (Sri N</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>.
<span class=SpellE>Raghunathan</span>). Being a scholar and thinker himself, he
took to intellectuals as a fish takes to water. He was supremely happy w</span><span

he was referred to as the modern Boswell to his mentor, Rt. <span class=SpellE>Hon’ble</span>
<span class=SpellE>Srinivasa</span> <span class=SpellE>Sastri</span>. As
Carlyle rightly says, “the history of the world is but the biography of great
men,” and in dealing with the ideas, ideals, liberation currents, episodes and
missions of Mr. <span class=SpellE>Sastri</span>, the biographer was giving us
a small genuine picture of the cultural history of a significant part of the
globe at a time when the flames of imperialism were being extinguished by
several engines of independence. It is history of absorbing interest because,
as John Ruskin averred, “the only history worth reading is the history of what
was done and seen, heard out of the mouths of the men who did and saw.” Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Rao’s</span> biography of <span class=SpellE>Sastri</span> set
right some gross misconceptions about a genuine patriot. For example, <span
class=SpellE>Pandit</span> Jawaharlal Nehru was highly critical of Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Sastri</span> </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>in his <i>Autobiography. </i>Edward
Thompson, a great friend of Nehru, candidly stated in his review of <span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“And
to <span class=SpellE>Srinivasa</span> <span class=SpellE>Sastry</span> in
particular, he (<span class=SpellE>Nehruji</span>) is consistently and grossly
unjust. I would ask him one question on a matter dear to him. How many
congressmen have shown <span class=SpellE>Sastri’s</span> concern for the
Indian Princes’ subjects? Some kinds of courage are cheaper than others in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> as
elsewhere, and <span class=SpellE>Sastri’s</span> courage has not been of the
cheap kind.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr. <span class=SpellE>Rao</span>
succeeded in projecting the true personality of <span class=SpellE>Sastri</span>,
his political Guru and in reconciling conflicting views so well that Sir C. P. <span
class=SpellE>Ramaswami</span> <span class=SpellE>Aiyar</span> said in admiration
that the biography gave us “not only a full, but also a <span class=SpellE>colourful</span>
and intrinsically faithful narrative of a rare type of scholar, orator, and
patriot.” It was indeed an exquisite cameo. It won the G. I. <span
class=SpellE>Watumull</span> Prize for 1964 ranking as it is with the
outstanding English biographies such as <span class=SpellE>Trevelyan’s</span> <span
class=SpellE><i>Macaulay</i></span><i>, </i>Andre <span class=SpellE>Maurois</span>
<span class=SpellE><i>Disraeli</i></span><i>. </i>Its value increased by the
biographer’s lucid and forceful exposition; his delicate wit and graceful
style. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.

universities, notable among which is the series on <span class=SpellE><i>Gokhale</i></span><i>

 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>. He was a
prolific writer propelled with the passion of calling a spade a spade He
contributed a number of articles advocating bilingualism in the Indian
educational system; ‘mother-tongue for literature and English for science and
for government and commercial uses.’ He coined the slogan “English ever, Hindi
never” and championed the cause of English. As a <span class=SpellE>Sahridaya</span>
pointed out, “the cause of English which suffered a great blow in the death of <span
class=SpellE><span class=GramE>Rajaji</span></span><span class=GramE>,</span>
now stands orphaned in the passing away of Mr. <span class=SpellE>Kodanda</span>
<span class=SpellE>Rao</span>.” It was perhaps, his unflinching stand on the
primacy of English that cost him his membership in the Servants of India
Society, which joined at no small sacrifice. After thirty-seven years of
service, this loyal servant was rather peremptorily ‘requested to resign’ from
the Society in 1958. The Society, which was to him a very unique institution in
the whole world, stands indeed impoverished by his leaving it because, had he
continued, he would have written its full history as he knew it longest, almost
right from its inception and loved it with his whole heart. It is, however,
gratifying that the Government of <span class=SpellE>Mysore</span> was pleased
to sanction him an honorarium of <span class=SpellE>Rs</span>. 500 per month
and for life in June 1971 recognition of his ‘outstanding public service.’ <o:p></o:p></span></p>

w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Moriah</span></st1:PlaceName> or <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">Mount</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Abu</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>,
or for that matter, on any mount, but rose from the reasoning mind. His heart
was firmly set against unconstitutional methods for achieving political ends,
however lofty and laudable the goal might be. In a recent interview with a
professor, he affirmed that he did not support the ominous movement of <span
class=SpellE>Jaya</span> <span class=SpellE>Prakash</span> <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span>.
His argument was plain and simple. Even in the British days, he and his friends
were stoutly opposed to the <span class=SpellE>agitational</span> approach even
for winning political independence for our country and for ventilating
citizens’ grievances. How could he accept a violent movement now when a popular
government is in power? It was not difficult, he said, to disrupt public life
in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>;
it had been our portion for centuries. It is imperative that one social or
political system should be substituted by a better system through
constitutional means alone as no progress is possible without order. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Endowed with winning manners, Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Rao</span> was one of Nature’s gentlemen, who possessed a delicate
sense of <span class=SpellE>humour</span>. Those who visited ‘Aloha’ (his
residence) in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Bangalore</span></st1:place></st1:City>
were invariably shown his ‘laboratory’, a name given to his kitchen. It would
be no exaggeration to state that it would be hard to find a simpler, purer man
of principle in contemporary <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
than Mr. <span class=SpellE>Rao</span>. According to his close friend Dr D. V. <span
class=SpellE>Gundappa</span>, his characteristic qualities were, besides
frankness, “a fine balancing of the opposites in argument and opinion and good
humouredness in dealing with men.” Mr. <span class=SpellE>Rao</span> was “never
sour or harsh in temper and never hurried in judgment” so that one might say in
the words of Shakespeare, “There was a Caesar! When <span class=GramE>comes</span>
such another?” </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Public memory being proverbially short, leaders even
of this generation tend to be forgotten soon after their death. We have the
famous example of <span class=SpellE>Subhas</span> <span class=SpellE>Bose</span>,
who was the darling of the youth in his time, but whose name is hardly known to
the students of today. Then what about the statesmen and national leaders who
died more than half-a-century ago? There is little material available to the
general reader on their life and work. Biography seems to be the weakest link
in contemporary Indian writing and Mr. <span class=SpellE>Chandrasekharan</span>
who has to his credit a full-length biography of his illustrious father in
Tamil, has done well in preparing a brief outline in English for the benefit of
the common reader, on the Occasion of his birth centenary earlier this year. It
gives a brief but comprehensive and factual account of the great man’s life and
work. He had a wide range of and his achievements were many-sided. </p>

P. S. <span class=SpellE>Sivaswami</span> <span class=SpellE>Aiyar’s</span>
tribute, quoted in this booklet, aptly sums up <span class=SpellE>Krishnaswami</span>
<span class=SpellE>Aiyar’s</span> legal personality: “Taking all things
together, in subtlety he might not have been superior to <span class=SpellE>Bhashyam</span>
<span class=SpellE>Iyengar</span>; in quickness of perception, he might not
have been superior to Sir S. <span class=SpellE>Subramania</span> <span

might not have been superior to Mr. Norton; but taking all in all, there was no
one who combined all the essentials of an advocate as Mr. <span class=SpellE>Krishnaswami</span>
<span class=SpellE>Aiyar</span>.” Corning as they did from one who was a
stickler for accuracy, these words can hardly improved upon as a contemporary
assessment. This was but one of the many facets of the diamond. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the political field his ties were closest with <span class=SpellE>Gokhale</span>,
whom he admired and resembled in many ways. A moderate by conviction, he was
perhaps an extremist by temperament and could get excited on the need for not
getting excited. Anecdotes are related by<i> </i>some of his younger
contemporaries describing how he often lost his temper with his friends and
co-workers on the merit of keeping a cool head and not losing one’s temper.
This is not very surprising as there are other instances of great men still
happily alive who find it harder to control their tempers than to maintain a
balance of mind. It is but a curious reflection on the tremendous vitality of
the man in each case. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

a political leader, <span class=SpellE>Krishnaswami</span> <span class=SpellE>Aiyar</span>

of his times. The author mentions how the <span class=SpellE>Sankaracharya</span>

“referred to <span class=SpellE>Krishnaswami</span> <span class=SpellE>Aiyar’s</span>

a serious-minded college professor, fresh from <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place

wrong with the well-meaning husband, but she comes to feel that she had been
missing the thrill of life in the placid home with a staid husband who seemed
to take her for granted and a peevish mother-in-law who would not. Her first
baby is still-born and this experience pulls her down further in her dejection.
But this serves as a turning-point too. The husband becomes more ardent and
imaginative and the mother-in-law more sympathetic. The ordeal she underwent in
the Hindu-Muslim riots brings the family closer together still and the dawn of
national independence finds them happier than ever before, basking in mutual
love and understanding. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

string to the main theme, though they are not properly woven into the fabric of
the novel as a whole. The story is well told, with a sense of subdued realism,
but it does not somehow quite succeed in gripping the reader’s attention. The
conflict suggested in more than one place is not worked out into a good drama
and the realities of life are not probed deeply enough to make a lasting
impression. But the novel is readable and the narrative has an easy flow,
though there is little in it that haunts the memory or fires the imagination. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

process we get a brilliant analysis of the concept of <span class=SpellE>Bhakti</span>.
The hymns are full of what is familiarly known as the <span class=SpellE>nayaka-nayaki</span>
<span class=SpellE>bhava</span> (or what Dr. <span class=SpellE>Mahadevan</span>
calls ‘the bridal mysticism’, in his inimitable manner) an allegory associated
with the <span class=SpellE>Alwars</span> and <span class=SpellE>Nayanmars</span>
and to some extent with the <span class=SpellE>sufis</span>. The combination of
deep piety with high literature is nothing new to us, but Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Mahadevan</span> has heightened the value of the book by giving
short but brilliant commentaries on the philosophical and literary quality of
each of the hundred verses. One example is his commentary on verse No. 69. It
is quite original and remarkable. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was, not very long ago, when it used to be said that what <st1:place w:st="on">Bengal</st1:place>
thought today the rest of the country would think tomorrow. It was particularly
true of the political and intellectual spheres. After<i> </i>the famine and
partition and other adversities of fortune this no longer holds good in
politics. In the realm of pure thought, however, and of literature, <st1:place
w:st="on">Bengal</st1:place> still gives ample evidence of being more sensitive
to new world trends than the other linguistic regions. The booklet under
review, which is one of the latest in the <span class=SpellE>Bhavan’s</span>
Book University series, is a reprint of Prof. <span class=SpellE>Kabir’s</span>
articles originally written over a quarter of a century ago. They were first
published in the Bengali periodical ‘<span class=SpellE>Chaturanga</span>’ and
in their English version they appeared some ten years later in the ‘<st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’ monthly.
They seek to understand the literary situation in terms of the social
phenomena, political forces and economic factors, which make it possible. With
the true instinct of a philosopher who goes to the fundamentals, the author
traces the role of the <span class=SpellE>Bhakti</span> movement in giving rise
to <span class=SpellE>Vaishnavite</span> lyricism of the impact of Muslim
invasion on the shape of the language in relaxing the grip of Sanskrit forms,
and of the British conquest in the growth of a new social and intellectual
outlook<i> </i>based in the dignity of the human individual and the supremacy
of reason. Among the great names, who are like landmarks in the growth of
modern Bengali poetry, enough space is devoted to Michael <span class=SpellE>Madhusudan</span>
<span class=SpellE>Dutt</span>, <span class=SpellE>Bankim</span> <span
class=SpellE>Chandra</span> <span class=SpellE>Chatterji</span> and <span

class=SpellE>Tagore</span> period, only <span class=SpellE>Nazrul</span> Islam
is discussed at some length. The account needs to be brought up-<span
class=SpellE>todate</span>. Though some of the conclusions may be
controversial, it is a model for originality of treatment, novelty in outlook
and lucidity of exposition. There is a felicity of expression that invests the
study with a compelling charm. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

there is no obvious comparison between C. P. Brown and C. R. <span
class=SpellE>Reddi</span> in their life and work, it is beyond any doubt that
both of them deserve to be remembered with gratitude by lovers of the Telugu
language and literature. Any attempt to perpetuate their memory is therefore
welcome, especially in the form in which it is sought to be done here. One
rescued many of the classics of Telugu poetry from decay and oblivion and
preserved for us reliable versions of their texts. The other gave us a new way
of looking at some of the popular classics. One was a pioneer in grammar,
lexicography and even the art of<i> </i>printing. The other was a pioneer in
literary criticism in its modern sense. One gave a new status and sanction to
the use of spoken Telugu in written works. The other felt that the<i> </i>spoken<i>
</i>dialect changing from district to district, it was best to stick to the
bookish form in the written word. Both had a classical background (though of
different kinds) and a modern outlook and stand above the common run of
scholars by the spark of originality that lit their work. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But,
it is out of the question that C. P. Brown’s achievement was by far the more
substantial and lasting of the two. That was certainly due, in a large measure,
to his spirit of dedication and capacity for concentration and his many-sided
interests in the field of scholarship. It is not always that one finds a
stranger to an Indian language taking to it with such minded devotion as Brown
did in the case of Telugu. He learnt it, to start with, as part of his official
duties as a junior official the Ceded Districts and <st1:place w:st="on">Northern
 <span class=SpellE>Circars</span></st1:place>. But he began to love it in
course of time and his whole life and fortune were spent in the digging up of
its treasures of literature. That a modern Telugu scholar should devote more
than ten years, off and on, to a study of the life and work of this great
savant of the last century is encouraging indeed. It is also evident that quite
a lot of hard work has gone into the collection of material for this biography.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
it is just as well to remember that the collection of data is but a part of the
biographer’s burden. And material in itself, rich and useful as it is, does not
constitute a biography, any more than tons of brick and mortar do a shapely
building. A good biographer must have a point of view that decides the pattern
of his work, he must have a sense of form and of style and thirdly he must know
what to put in and what to keep out. The material presented here, partly in
English and partly in Telugu, was possibly collected in the course of the
author’s research on a thesis which had since been published in book-form under
the title “The Influence of English on Telugu literature.” The initial chapter
in English entitled ‘C. P. Brown and his literary pursuits’ seems to have
appeared in ‘<span class=SpellE>Swatantra</span>’ weekly as an article some
years ago and is presumably incorporated here as it is. As for the regular
text, it looks as if there are more words within quotation marks than without
(which incidentally used to be a matter for congratulation in our college days)
and as many in the foot-notes to every page as above the <span class=SpellE>demarkation</span>
line. And then there are almost as many passages in English as in Telugu! It
looks as if the real choice was between producing a book of 100 pages in
English or of the same length in Telugu, but by some admirable legerdemain of
the art of book-making he has just pulled off a substantial book of over 250
pages which is part English and part Telugu! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the best part of the book is only to give what Brown wrote in his articles and
notes and what his numerous correspondents wrote to him, one is at a loss to
imagine what the present author is here for. There is here more incorporation
than interpretation, more documentation than discussion. The material gathered
is unexceptionable, but the biography promised is yet to be. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

present biography of Dr. C. R. <span class=SpellE>Reddi</span>, perhaps the
first of its kind in Telugu or English, serves to illustrate the point that the
varied and picturesque life of a man of genius need not make an excellent
biography in itself, if the writer does not know how to do it. It also
highlights the fact that biography is yet a new branch of literature in most of
the Indian languages. We have fulsome eulogies, yes, and resounding panegyrics,
but good balanced biographies, not yet. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In his incisive foreword to this book, Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Narla</span> has asked the author (who seems to admire Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Reddi</span> on this side idolatry) to try to ask himself why a
man of such brilliant endowments of the mind, had failed to make a mark in life
in keeping with his distinction as a speaker, writer, poet and critic. <span
class=SpellE>Narla</span> puts his finger on the right spot when he traces the
failure to certain inherent contradictions in <span class=SpellE>Reddi’s</span>
own character and mental make-up. A Plato, with the propensities of a Puck,
would he not be an absurdity indeed in any walk of life? </p>

author, however, goes on in his own self-complacent way to complain against a
society and a province which did not find the proper opportunities for a man of
Dr. <span class=SpellE>Reddi’s</span> gifts and attainments. A genius, it is
said, not only snatches the opportunities where they arise, but creates new
ones where there are none. Also the account is tolerable where <span
class=SpellE>Reddi’s</span> work in Telugu literature is concerned. But where
it relates to his work as an educationist and his speeches and writings in
English and other subtleties on the floor of the House or outside it, the
author finds himself frankly out of his depths.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

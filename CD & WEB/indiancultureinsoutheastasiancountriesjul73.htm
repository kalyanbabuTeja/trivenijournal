has played a very important role in forming the cultural tradition of Asia. The
Indian colonies in the Far East must ever remain the high watermark of maritime
and colonial enterprise of the ancient Indians. An awareness of the unity of
all life, a love for the ultimate and the universal in preference to the
immediate and the particular, tolerance, co-operation, and pacifism are some of
the elements contributed by India to these countries. The account of the
process of this contribution is very interesting. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

institutions in Burma or Siam or Indonesia are just an extension of the Indian
institutions. The territory stretching from Burma to Indonesia was known in the
ancient days as the Land of Gold, and Indian merchants and princes settled
there and founded their own colonies and spread Indian cultural influences. The
Buddhist missionaries carried the torch of a new religion to these countries.
All these people introduced Indian customs and manners, religion and
philosophy, ritual, art and literature wherever they went. Indianised kingdoms
soon came into being, either as a result of an Indian imposing himself on the native
population, or else through a native chief adopting a foreign civilization. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

spread of Indian influence was in the nature of ‘waves’. There were f<span

second or third century to the twelfth or thirteenth <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>centuries </span>when following the Muslim invasion of India Buddhist
monks and teachers were forced to seek shelter in these countries. As a result
of the impact of these waves there was total ‘Indianisation’ of some parts, while
in others Indian culture acted as a stimulus calling forth a response from the
local genius. From this point of view we can put these countries into two zones–the
Western and the Eastern. Ceylon, Burma, Siam, the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra
which fall in the Western Zone underwent a thorough-going Indianisation,
whereas in the Eastern Zone comprising the parts of Indonesia and Indo-China
the local genius was not completely submerged by Indian influence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was the first of all outer lands to come under the Indian influence. Prince
Vijaya landed here in the fifth century B.C., married a local princess and
became the father of the Sinhalese people. Indian arts and crafts began to be
practised in Ceylon as also the rice cultivation. In the third century B. C.,
Ashoka sent his son and daughter to Ceylon with a message or Buddhism and King
Tissa of Ceylon received them cordially and adopted Buddhism. He built the
first stupa and the first monastery in Ceylon. King Dutthagamani constructed
Ruanweli Degaba and the Brazen Palace. Several gigantic stupas reveal the influence
of Gupta art and architecture. The paintings of Sigiriya are an extension of
the Ajanta school. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Pyu alphabet is greatly influenced by Indian alphabet. Brahmanism also found a
fruitful soil in Burma but finally Theravada became the official religion and
Pali helped the Burmese language “to grow, deepen and expand continually.”
Under the kings of Upper Burma Indian religion and learning, arts, music,
architecture and sculpture flourished there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

maintained close religious contacts with Ceylon and Pali. Buddhism of Ceylon
became dominant throughout the whole of Burma. Some eight hundred pagodas still
stand in good condition in Upper Burma. When the Muslims invaded India a large
number of Buddhist monks sought shelter in Burmese monasteries and brought a
fresh influx of Indian ideas with them. The Indian influence is reflected in
Burmese customs and manners, script and literature even today. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Indianisation of Siam took place in the second century A. D., when a colony

Dvaravati, the Indianised kingdom of Siam, ruled from Cambodia to the Bay of
Bengal till the tenth century and Gandhar, another such kingdom, for three
centuries till it was conquered by Kublai Khan. Buddhism became the official
religion of Siam and in the thirteenth century the Thai king built a Buddhist
temple which was a replica of the famous Bodh-gaya Temple. The Siamese language
borrowed its script from India, and Pali deeply influenced its development.
Indian Samskaras have become a part and parcel of Siamese custom and ritual.
The Ramayana and the Mahabharata have exercised a great influence on the
Siamese literature and art. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Education was widespread in </span>Kambuja and students went to ashrams which
were on the model of Indian ashrams. These ashrams were powerful centres of
Indian culture in Kambuja. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Kambuja, Champa was also a great centre of Hindu culture. The earliest
colonists came from India and the Hindu king Sri Mara established a dynasty in
the second century A. D. which lasted till the fifteenth century. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Chams created remarkable sculptures and a highly original type of brick temple
architecture. The best known groups of temples are at Myson, nong Duong and Po
Nagar. The Myson group has about sixty temples ranging in date from the seventh
to the twelfth centuries. The temple remains at Dong Duong date from the ninth
and tenth centuries. The Cham figure sculpture closely followed Gupta models
both in theme and technique. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

people followed a caste system similar to that in India, but the Brahmins,
although holding a high position in the society, did not dominate the king.
Hindu customs and festivals were prevalent and Sanskrit was the official
language of the country. The Ramayana and the Mahabharata were widely studied
besides Hindu philosophy and sacred texts of the Shaivites. Champa disappeared
from history in the fifteenth century. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

achievements of the Indian colonists in the South-East Asian countries have
been very great. They introduced Indian religions, literature, philosophy,
social and political institutions and art to millions of people who readily
accepted whatever ancient India had to offer. The Indian expansion was purely
cultural and there was never a military conquest or annexation. This cultural
conquest produced brilliant results of an abiding value. India, thus, played
the role of a great civilizing force in the life of the people of South-East
Asia. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

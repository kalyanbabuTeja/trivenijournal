<P>Stretched in front, the gruesome citadel lies dilapidated…….</P>
<P>where, of old, lion-like men, brave and venturesome, their dwellings made;</P>
<P>where Nerbudda rang through the echoing precipices,</P>
<P>told them of their duty, sang the songs of success.</P>
<P>Flowery beds were strewn in this very fort’s pleasure-palaces</P>
<P>and when the fire of freedom flamed, all were burnt to ashes.</P>
<P>Their only goddess was their sharp sword-blade;</P>
<P>and to anoint it ever with blood, their creed.</P>
<P>Not only life but all that life is for</P>
<P>they gave, in their freedom’s need.</P>
<P>Such heroes dwelt of old in this–in this very heap!</P>
<P>But now doth here some lowly priest the idol-goddess worship.</P>
<P>His hand besmears the image with sandal-paste, vermilion powder mixed.</P>
<P>Drunk with intoxicating ‘bhang,’ he babbles a tale of old, incoherent and fixed, . . .  </P>
<P>with feelings none–glad for a pie or two!</P>
<P>Such is the sport of time,</P>
<P>not here alone but everywhere!</P>
<P>In us too no feeling arises, </P>
<P>For we dwell in a dingy attic, and that one rented!</P>
<P>And say we, contentedly,</P>
<P>‘Why should such lowly creatures as ourselves great mansions have?’</P>

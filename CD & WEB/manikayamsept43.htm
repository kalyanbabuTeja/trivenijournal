mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>In my young days I took a solemn vow not to
entertain thoughts of marriage till I completed my studies and entered a
profession. Somehow I passed my exam and took up service. Then, accompanied by
a friend, I started on the quest of a personal inspection of prospective brides.
Days in that year’s summer were particularly hot. As a result of these forced
marches and irregular meals, our health was impaired. At last late one morning
we plodded our weary way to a Village. It was a mere hamlet. We felt dead
tired. The Villagers showed us a house to lodge in. It was as much as we could
do to dismount from the cart and drag ourselves along into the house<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It was a thatched house, but seemed to have been
designed by men who had ideas of comfort and convenience. There was nobody at
home. The owner of the house had gone out on some professional business. There
was no trace even of women. During our journey, my friend was invariably in
charge of the commissariat. He now surveyed the house at close quarters and
exclaimed: “My friend, today we are destined to fast!” He fretted and fumed and
with a wry face squatted down on the mat I occupied.</p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>By and by, a girl returned from the village tank
with a water-pot on her shoulder. I would have addressed a few words to any
elderly person accompanying her, but there was none such. Though it was but 10
o’clock in the morning, the sun shone with terrific heat as at mid-day. Both of
us were a prey to extreme hunger, my friend was hardly able to speak; I was
equally helpless. Distress stands not on ceremonies. Casting aside diffidence,
I said, “Madam, we are hunger-stricken travelers, Pity you are alone in the
house! It is cruel to ask you to play the hostess to us. We shall cook for
ourselves if you will kindly provide some rice and a vessel. So spoke I words
of formal etiquette, but, as a matter of fact, we were unable even to move a
little finger!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

who, unasked, was preparing our food appeared the goddess of Hospitality.
Unable to speak words of thankfulness and concealing tears of joy, I slid down
on to the mat. My friend and I were soon sunk in deep slumber.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

food.” These words emanating from a masculine throat fell on my ears two or
three times before I woke up. “I have found fault with my daughter for not
having served you food already, Get up please,” so saying the master of the
house led us into the dining hall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>I do not vividly remember the story of our first
meal in that house. The words of the host at the dinner were but faintly heard
by us. W e ate our food, nodding in sleep. Though the stimulus of food in the
stomach enabled us partly to overcome sleep, still immediately after breakfast,
we applied ourselves again to bed. We woke not till evening twilight. We rose
and looked round; the master of the house was engaged in some house-hold work,
while his good daughter was busy with preparations for a night-meal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>By supper-time, our drowsiness cleared off. Till
then, mine host had not asked of us any questions. Nor do we remember any such
queries if ever they were put. He appeared to be a person of a benevolent
disposition notwithstanding adverse family conditions. We felt distressed to
hear that the recent calamity of his wife’s demise made him an utter dependent
on his tender-aged daughter. When he apologised that he had forgotten to ask us
about our business, my friend Ramanatham gave him a brief account of our
journey. Said he in conclusion, “Thus sir, we are quite spent up in these
matrimonial trips of my friend, Manohar. Always there is some hitch. He frets
that beauty does not go along with education nor music with good looks.
Goodness knows about his marriage but it goes ill if I do not reach home soon!
Such was Ramanatham’s determination. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Ramanatham was a well-meaning young man of a quiet
disposition. He would not do things hastily, nor would he excuse precipitate
action on the part of others. Before retiring to bed that night we had some
little conversation between ourselves. “Manohar, this obstinacy of yours in
matters matrimonial will not do. Even traversing whole continents at this rate
will bring us no nearer the girl of your choice!” so spoke out my jaded friend.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The next morning, I was startled from my bed by his
voice. My limbs were heavy. My eyes were burning. As soon as the sounds of the
wheels of his cart were audible, he appeared near my bed. “Manohar,’ I come to
bid adieu. You should not travel in this state of health. But it is not proper
that we should both stay in a stranger’s house. Permit me to go. Start as soon
as you get better.” To this I replied, “Yes, but what of our errand?” My
friend, who was impatiently entering the cart just then, remarked, “It does not
matter much. Make up your mind and your marriage will soon be an accomplished
fact! So saying, he left me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the rising sun, rose the temperature of my body. My limbs ached with a racking
pain. I felt sorry that my only companion had left me. My suffering grew in
intensity as night wore on. Whenever I opened my eyes, the figure of the host
soothing my limbs, and that of his daughter helping me to some drink were
visible like hazy forms in dreamland!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Though that fever raged but a single day and night,
I was utterly prostrated. In the first place, I lost all appetite for food. If
I left bed and took but a couple of steps, my eyes reeled. In that predicament
my sole refuge was the master of the house. His goodness beggars all
description. He was not at all vexed that a stranger had intruded himself upon
his hospitality and remained a guest for days together. On the other hand, he
patently administered medicine and spoke cheering words like a guardian angle.
His only regret was that the services he rendered were not more!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>But what about his daughter? She was an incarnation
of the side of his nature. It is rare to find such virtue in combination such
discretion at so tender an age. She would ungrudgingly accomplish her household
tasks with the half-skill she had attained. Many were tireless devices she
employed in the preparation of dainties and <i>chutneys </i>to stimulate my
deadened palate and re-establish there a taste for food. It is due to the
gentle services of that kind-hearted maiden that I soon rallied and picked up
strength. Then it was that I realised the significance of the truth that the
mother is latent in the girl. Manikyam was a real gem. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>One afternoon, lying on my bed, I began a long
review of my own circumstances. “How mysterious are the workings of Destiny! I
started on a particular errand with a friend, but illness soon found me a guest
in the house of strangers. Now this village has become my sweet home, and the
inmates of this house my longstanding friends! What an irony that these fasts
and feasts have utterly drowned all thought of matrimony in me!”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

new blood began to course in my veins, old thoughts revolved in my mind with
their wonted rapidity. I would ponder over Ramanatham’s parting words: “If
there is the least truth in them, God has yet to create a bride for me!
Otherwise, I must wed a girl full of frailties and foibles–” Thus as thoughts
of marriage revived in me, my mind fell a prey to an endless tangle of
harassing thoughts leaving me exhausted! I would then exert myself to divert my
attention from this painful theme.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>As in those days my mind had no serious engagement,
I spent my time in the contemplation of my surroundings. In this vast stage of
the world, my eyes beheld but two actors: they are Manikyam and her father. The
survey of the character of father and daughter constituted my chief theme and
pastime. The amiable qualities of the parent shone with redoubled brilliance in
the child, though the physical attractions of the latter were not half so much
in evidence in the former. Her elegance was not of the kind which dazzles the
eye instantaneously–young men and easily mistaken in the appreciation of this
type of beauty. The full extent of her charms was percei1tible only to those
who beheld the twinkling eyes radiating the beauty of her intellect. Moreover,
her beauty manifested itself in every spoken word. Her sweet voice was but an
echo of pure and generous heart. Her honeyed words were calculated to charm
away all ills of body and mind! Her little snatches of work amidst song and

pastimes of village girl. Though obliged to do all domestic work single-handed,
she would not always get stuck up in it, but would snatch intervals of rest.
The afternoon hours were her holiday time. Then would she go visiting and
receive visits from girl-friends in the neighbourhood. The ornaments of these
girls in the sport were the jasmine buds in the garden and the red lilies of
the tank! These constituted Manikyam’s jewels even afterwards, adding a fresh
charm to her beauty. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

afresh of the topic of marriage which it had been my endeavour to forget. But
this time I realised fully the truth of Ramanatham’s words. The doubts which
had harassed me hitherto now vanished. “If I prefer the married state, there is
only one girl in the wide world whom I must needs choose. If I secure her, I
secure life’s happiness. If otherwise, I must bid adieu to married life.” This
was my firm resolution!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was emphatic that it was for me. I wondered what in the world was the
relationship between me and these blessed folk of Kalavalur! But one or hints
dropped by him instantaneously revived forgotten memories. This letter, then,
was about my own dear Manikyam! The writer was her own father. The missing of
the previous letter must have been the work of the inmates of my house. How
stupid their action is! Else, I would have seen my Manikyam long ago. Fearing
further delay, I got into a swift conveyance and soon reached the destination.
The red lily, the pride of the village tank, appeared withered on its stalk. No
smiles of the people in the street greeted me!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

heeding the words of the people who said that it was all too late, I was soon
at the bed-stead of the patient. Her father, who was administering to her the
last drops of water with basil leaves, noticed my advent with a moistened eye.
Manikyam, in whom life was flickering, opened her eyes wide and stared at me.
Though the body was all but consumed by poisonous fever, the eyes shone bright
in all their natural lustre–tears were now flowing down copiously from those
eyes, like dew-drops from the petals of the morning blue lily. With her right
hand which she had lifted with effort she beckoned to me. I went nearer and
touched the hand which was fast getting cold. Slowly she lifted up the palm of
my hand to her lips and imprinted thereon a faint kiss. Her head fell back.
“Dear Manikyam, I have come. Do not fear.” So strove I to put in a word of
comfort. As if to acknowledge this the patient attempted a nod but her eyes
dilated in a wild gaze. Life was extinct from those orbs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Manikyam is gone! Marriage has now no interest for me. My relations with
womankind are at an end. All those objects of nature which resemble her
beautiful limbs and which remind me of her, give me excruciating pain. The
sight of the blue lily brings tears into eyes. The jasmine buds which graced
the braid of her tresses are poison to me. The sweet odours of the tender mango
with which she restored my appetite blast my heart!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Sometimes, the world appears like hell to me. At such times, I feel tempted to

soon that the quintessence of life consists in the control of sorrow, I divert
m thoughts and seek to subdue the mind by the reins of duty. But no effort of
mine is able to wean my heart from the memory of Manikyam. M friends have,
tried to laugh it away as mere sentiment, and teach me asceticism, but to me
Manikyam is a living Reality. Relations have prescribed marriage as an antidote
to my obsession. But the maiden who inspired pure love in me, but who was
mightily disappointed in the realisation of conjugal happiness with me here
below since her own life was cut short by cruel Fate,–I cannot bring myself to
break off my sacred relation with my beloved one and take to another.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

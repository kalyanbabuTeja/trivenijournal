<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Parliamentary
democracy may be broadly described as a system of Government where a nation
governs itself through its representatives assembled in a Parliament, as
opposed to direct democracy where the nation’s laws are made in popular
assemblies as in ancient Greek City-states. In this sense, all modern states
might be said to be parliamentary democracies. But, in a narrow sense, it may
be described as a system where the nation delegates its sovereign power to an
elected Parliament for the governance of the country, out of which the
executive is born and to which the latter is responsible. True it is that there
is an executive Head independent of the Parliament, but he is only nominal or
‘constitutional’ and does not enjoy any real power. English Government is a
typical example of this system, as opposed to the American system, where the
nation elects both the legislature and the executive, separately, and entrusts
them with separate powers, no one being ‘responsible’ to the other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
of the hottest controversies raised in India, when our Constitution was on the
anvil, and even later, was whether our system belongs to the American or to the
British type. The Fathers of the Constitution, without exception, had no doubt
at all on this point that what they had adopted was, in the words of Patel,
‘the parliamentary system of constitution, the British type of Constitution
with which we are familiar.’ But most of the professors of political science
(whose voice does not as yet count for much in India), with only a few
exceptions, were equally emphatic, in the words of a worthy among them, that
‘the Constitution that was inaugurated on the 26th. Jan. 1950 <i>was not </i>of
the British type, whatever might be the intentions of the Fathers.’ The bone of
contention was the power which the Constitution confers on the President. A
point of great significance. often missed by many pandits, is that, while the
Constitution undoubtedly ‘vests’ the executive power in the President (Art. 53
(1)) and confers other extraordinary powers like ordinance-making and emergency
powers, not even the legislative power is ‘vested’ in </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
Parliament–nowhere is it said that Parliament makes the law in India. On the
other hand, usage, customs and ordinance have been included in ‘law’ by our
Constitution. The President is the fulcrum around whom the other organs
revolve, but not the Parliament as it ought to be in a parliamentary system;
that has been the line of argument of what we may call the ‘critics’ of the
Constitution, who expected that the actual working of the Constitution would
bear them out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the actual working of the Constitution during the first five years
(1951-52–1956-57) seems to belie their expectations. On the contrary, it may be
claimed that the foundations for the tradition of parliamentary democracy have
been firmly laid in this period; and it may be noted that tradition or
convention is a great factor in politics, and especially in the parliamentary
type. The President of India, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, behaved in an exemplary
manner. With an undisputed popularity which he gained as a disciple of
Gandhiji, Dr. Prasad has truly personified the will of </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
Indian nation, and became its real head; and he only reigned, but not governed.
That he commanded considerable influence </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>in the counsels of the
Government of India and that no important decision was taken without consulting
him, is probably true, but that also is an attribute of parliamentary
government–the king possessing, in Bagehot’s immortal words, ‘a right to be
consulted, the right to encourage, and the right to warn.’ But outwardly, the
decisions are the decisions of the Council of Ministers, and there has not been
a single instance where he tried to exercise his power. The President has
remained ‘nominal’, and there is no doubt about it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
does it mean that the foundations of parliamentary democracy have been firmly
laid? Critics could as well point out that certain exceptionally favourable
circumstances have brought about this happy consummation, of which the personal
factor has played the most important part, and these might not repeat
themselves again. In the first place, Dr. Prasad was also the President of the
Constituent Assembly, and so, like<i> </i>General Washington in the U. S.,
could appreciate the role of a ‘Constitutional President.’ In the second<i> </i>place,
he and the majority party in the Parliament have the same political complexion
believing in the same principles and social values. And, above all, he and
Prime Minister Nehru have been comrades in arms for over a quarter of a
century, and have learnt the value of ‘give and take’. Nehru and Prasad long
ago learnt under Gandhiji the art of playing the two blades of a scissors,
Nehru playing the active role.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Another
favorable feature that prevented the active intervention of the President was
that the Congress Party had an </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>unassailable majority in both Houses of
Parliament, and this party had an undisputed leader in Pandit Nehru. The result
was that the President had neither the headaches of the French President in
finding out stable ministries, nor the opportunities of the English Kings in
the 18th century to fish in troubled political waters. In other words, the
Parliament had been strong enough to resist any possible inroads into its
stronghold of sovereign powers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Does
it mean, however, that if the President has not exercised the power, the
Parliament did? Here again we have to understand the correct role of Parliament
in a Government of this sort. Contrary to the popular view, Parliament in
Britain does not govern, nor is it intended to govern. As Jennings reminds us,
its function is to criticise, to supervise and to act as a liaison </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>between
the Government and the people; that is, as Ilbert concludes, the objective of
this type of Government is ‘a strong exe</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>cutive Government,
tempered and controlled by constant, vigilant, and representative criticism.’
In other words, it is ministers that exercise power, but they, though not
elected by Parliament, are still responsible to it–collectively, says Art. 75
(3) of our Constitution, it may be noted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
this extent, our Constitution has worked as a parliamentary system, because it
is an undoubted fact that in India so far it is ministers that exercised the
real power. What we have to examine here is to what extent their action has
been (i) collective, and (ii) responsible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Collective
responsibility, as understood in England, has many implication. One is that all
decisions of the executive are binding on all ministers, whether they
individually subscribe to that view or not, which further implies that all such
decisions are placed before the full Cabinet and discussed fully, and that
where a particular minister finds it difficult to own it, he would resign
before he openly opposes it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
may well be noted that collective responsibility is not merely based on the
dictum that two heads are better than one, but has evolved in England as an
organic part of that Constitution, as a necessary result of a need felt to
stand united against both King and Parliament. This need, again in England, has
been greatly reduced by the disappearance of the King as a potent claimant to
power on the one hand, and by the emergence of party discipline on the other,
which ensures easy victory in the Commons to the party, however great might be
the internal differences of opinion (as seen in the recent case of ‘police
action’ in Egypt). Collective responsibility stands, in England, both as a
matter of convention and because of a need for collective wisdom. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Introduced
as a mechanical, part of an artificially made Constitution, collective
responsibility seems to work in India as all mechanical aids do more to order
than due to an impulse felt for its need. We do not know the internal working
of the Cabinets in India, but to the extent to which we are enabled to know,
there seem to be a few cracks already formed in collective thinking and cabinet
solidarity. The statements made by the late Dr. Ambedkar, and C. D. Deshmukh on
their resignations, both point to this particular aspect of the working of
Cabinets, that important decisions are taken elsewhere than at the Cabinet
meeting, and that ministers come to know about them, as the members of the
public, only from the newspapers. Even Pandit Nehru confessed once or twice
that he did not know the decisions taken by a particular ministry on a
particular point. There is enough evidence to discern the evolution of two
broad tendencies: that individual ministers enjoy a great latitude to take
decisions over a large field without consulting the full Cabinet, or even the
Prime Minister; and that some important decisions are taken by sub-committees
of the Cabinet, or groups of ministers, and these decisions may not be brought
before the full Cabinet, depending upon the wish of the Prime Minister. But
such tendencies are neither peculiar to India alone, nor are they undesirable
by themselves. Governmental activity has increased manifold, and has become
technical and complicated since the days when the principles of collective
responsibility were first discerned and put down in written formulae.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
of the important causes behind them is the dominating personality of Pandit
Nehru. Panditji seems to believe in the ancient dictum of administration:
‘choose the most capable lieutenants, and then trust them’. But that is a
dictum suitable for the monarchical type of Government, successfully put into
practice by Akbar in India. To-day, Governments should not only be ‘capable’
but also ‘responsible.’ While the capacity of the </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Central
ministers is a moot point and a matter of opinion, it can certainly be said
that ‘responsibility’ has been blurred, and </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>many a minister has
taken shelter under the protecting wings of the Prime Minister, who had only to
get up and say, “I take the full responsibility” to silence all criticism and
opposition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
has been one sharp exception–in the case of Sri Lal Bahadur Sastry. But it is a
sad case setting a wrong example. To hold a minister responsible for a
conspiracy of Nature and neglect of three minor officials on the spot in a
remote part of the country, is neither good administration, nor setting up good
tradition. Ministers execute policy, but do not adjust nuts and bolts to
railway coaches. Imagine a Railway Minister resigning every time an engine
derails, or a Home Minister resigning every time there is an armed dacoity, or
a Health Minister resigning every time there is a small-pox epidemic! And if
responsibility is accepted at all, then the whole ministry should have resigned
but not a mere individual, as our Constitution speaks of collective but not of
individual responsibility <i>(Art. 75).</i><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Whatever
it might be, there were other cases, where individual resignation or at least
severe criticism and censure were indicated, but the ministers escaped lightly
and remained in their posts. Broadly, there are two agencies to check these
fads and faults of individual ministers in a system such as ours, where
collective thinking has gone into thin air. One is the Prime Minister, and the
other is the House of the People. The real difficulty with our Prime Minister
is that he has got too many irons in the fire to spare time. One lesson that
the working of our Constitution has so far given us is that a Prime Minister
should not have any portfolio for himself so that he may be available and free
both for advising other ministers and scrutnising their work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
House could have done something, especially because our Constitution gives it
full powers to make its own Rules of Procedure. But several factors again have
contributed to convert it into an ineffective body. In the first place,
everywhere in the world, legislative bodies are becoming mere ‘Talkie Houses’,
and registering rubber stamps; and our Founding Fathers constitutionalised this
defect when they modelled our House on the pattern of the British House of
Commons. In the second place, the Congress Party, which has got such an
overwhelming majority in the House, is a strong monolithic party working under
great discipline. Pandit Nehru has only to look around in the House to silence
all opposition from his own followers: and at times, one opposition member
confessed to me, even the opposition members are afraid to talk freely when
Pandit Nehru puts on a wry face!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
third factor, however, has contributed largely to reduce the efficacy of the
House. Innocuous beginnings, which were made in the middle of the thirties in
the Provinces, of holding informal meetings of the Legislature Parties for
mutual consultations, have now developed them into parallel legislatures which
are overshadowing the real Houses. In these meetings, minister come and explain
policies, answer questions, and even the budget </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>is discussed
and ‘passed’. It is here only, if any, that real discussion can take place, but
even here Pandit Nehru’s presence has a great silencing effect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thus
if the over-powering personality of Pandit Nehru and the solidarity of the
Congress Party have prevented the establishment of the presidential type of
executive, the same factors have also prevented the establishment of a true
type of parliamentary system; the strength of the present system is also the
cause of its weakness. While we can declare emphatically that the working of
the Constitution has not established the presidential type, we cannot say with
equal emphasis that it has laid the foundations for a parliamentary type of
executive. In fact, we cannot say to which type our executive leans; it is a
unique type, where Pandit Nehru holds a unique position–we can call it a <i>Parliamentary
</i>system of<i> </i>executive.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Not
that it is undesirable by itself. For the last five years and odd, India has
been enjoying a stable form of democracy, while the other new-born democracies
of the East have not yet recovered from their birth-pangs: and this is largely
due to the unique position of Pandit Nehru in Indian politics. In fact, Pandit
Nehru is the darling of the Nation–the uncrowned King of India. And if the
crown is not yet placed on his head, it is not because the people would be
unwilling, but Pandit Nehru himself spurns it. No democratic leader in any free
country enjoys as much popular esteem as our Prime Minister in India; and even
dictators might envy his magic spell over the masses. A democrat with the drive
of a dictator, and a dictator with a love of democracy, there is no rival to
Pandit Nehru either in his own party or in the country–but that is the crux of
our problem. In the parliamentary system of England, a Gladstone had always a
Disraeli, and an Eden a Macmillan, but in our own country now, in the <i>‘Parliamentary
Government of India’, </i>Nehru is the Sun of his solar system.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is no doubt that Pandit Nehru will be our Prime Minister for the next five
years, and probably, for many more years to come. The Nation that adores him

the socialistic pattern of society, would adore him more if in the next five
years Pandit Nehru would help establishment of sound traditions of
parliamentary Government for the guidance of the less fortunate of his
successors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

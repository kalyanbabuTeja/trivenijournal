<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The coming together of the K. M. P. and Socialist Parties,
and the final emergence of the Praja-Socialists as an all-India party wedded to
constitutional, parliamentary democracy, are events of great significance in
recent Indian history. During the last General Elections, the electorate had to
choose between a bewildering variety of parties, not to mention the
Independents owing no party allegiance. In the actual working of democratic
institutions, the presence of a number of ‘unattached’ members of legislatures
is apt to create confusion. The party position being in a state of continual
flux, there can be no stable Government functioning for a resonable stretch of
time. The leaders of the main parties–the government and the opposition–have to
exhaust themselves in unending efforts to win over the Independents, who cannot
hope to hold office but can turn the scales in moments of crisis. This
generates an unhealthy atmosphere of intrigue, and even the most powerful of
Cabinets cannot pursue a consistent policy for the welfare of the State. The
organisation of the legislators of a country on party lines may have its
disadvantages; in particular, it stifles individual initiative on the part of
private members of every party. But it makes for a clear enunciation of
political principles and programmes. The Citizen, when he exercises his vote,
has a notion, however vague, of the kind of administration he is helping to put
in office. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>But even after the elimination of independent
members, a multiplicity of political parties can still be built up, with
distinct programmes, and occupying positions of varying degrees of importance,
in between the Government and the Opposition, This again leads to frequent
coalitions between one of the major parties and one or more of the minor ones,
to ensure a working majority for the Government of the day. The coalition may
be the result of ‘eve of election’ understandings, or of understandings arrived
at in the brief interval between the declaration of the results of the election
and the actual assumption of office by one of the major <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'>parties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>While
an organised parliamentary opposition is the life-breath of<i> </i>democracy,
and the surest antidote to the growth of totalitarianism, it is imperative that
the opposition should not be a miscellaneous assortment of parties drawn
together for the time being and acting with the sole object of overthrowing the
Government, without regard to that Government’s wisdom and beneficence. To
avoid the repeated emergence of opposition parties of this type, every
democratic State should seek to limit its parties to two, so that there is
always a well-knit opposition prepared to take up office and able to exercise
restraint on its members.<i><o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Although India may be unable to enter so soon on a
two party era, she must set her face against the continued functioning of too
many minor parties. It is from this point of view that the formation of the
Praja-Socialist Party is to be welcomed. When the present anomaly of a
K.M.P.-Communist alliance in the State Legislature of Madras is brought to its
inevitable end, it will become possible for the new Party to re-shape its
policies on an all-India basis. During the last General Elections the slogan of
the Socialists was, ‘Vote as you please, but not for the Congress or, the
Communists.” They imagined they were forming an anti-Congress and
anti-Communist front. On the other hand, the slogan of the K.M.P. was, “Vote
for anyone except the Congress canditiate.” Their sole concern was the
formation of a united opposition to the Congress. Thus there was a marked
difference between the attitudes of the K.M.P. and Socialist Parties in
relation to the Communists. In Andhra, the Communists made political capital
out of the anti-Congress feeling generated by the persistent appeals of
erstwhile Congress leaders like Sri T. Prakasam to “throw out the Congress”.
While the K.M.P. led Prakasam hoped to gain a majority of the seats from the
Andhra area, they merely helped the Communists to achieve victories far beyond
their expectations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The leaders of the Praja Socialist Party must soon
make up their minds as to which is the ‘lesscr evil’ in Indian public life–the
Communists or the Congress. If their devotion to peaceful democratic methods
for the winning of political power is sincere, and it, further, they are
convinced that the Communists are in error in their adherence to violence and
their allegiance to an outside Power, the leaders of the Praja-Socialist Party
must show a marked preference for the Congress. If, in future, a situation
arises in which the country has to choose between democracy and dictatorship,
and between non-violence and violencc in the shaping of our home politics, the
Praja-Socialists must definitely align themselves with the Congress. Quite
apart from such future developments, they ought to prepare themselves even now
for closer co-operation with the Congress Governments at the Centre and in the
States, in all matters concerning the progress and welfare of the Indian Union.
The line that divides them from the Congress is thin; their differences are
temperamental rather than, doctrinal. Even the doctrinal differences are not
such as to exclude the possibility of common action in the immediate future. It
is by adopting this attitude that they can stave off a violent revolution, to
which they are as much opposed as the Congress.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>A Press Commission has been appointed to investigate
the many problems affecting Indian journalism and to determine the relations
between the profession, the Government, and the public. Its personnel has not
given satisfaction in certain quarters, on the ground particularly that
influential bodies like the Southern India journalists Federation are not
represented on it. It is also urged that a weightage has been given to the
exponents of the view that journalism is an industry and a trade, and no longer
a profession and a mission. The importation of Trade Union methods into the
field of journalism is resented by some of the older Indian journalists. Having
devoted the best part of their lives to the profession of journalism at a time
when material rewards were few and the ideals of service and sacrifice were in
the ascendant, they find it difficult to realise why present day entrants into
the sacred shrine should think so much of wages, bonuses and increments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
invasion of the money power, and with it the emergence of a new class of Press
Barons has, however, wrought a change. The big daily newspapers, like the big
Cinema Studios, involve the expenditure of money on vastly increased scale. As
in all other commercial concerns, the management keeps a vigilant eye on the
balance sheets and the profit and loss accounts. There is a perpetual effort to
increase the returns and keep down the costs of production. In this new
atmosphere of commercialism, the interests of young journalist are likely to be
overlooked. He has, therefore, to increase his bargaining strength by becoming
a member of an organised body which can treat with the management on terms of
equality and even summon the State power to intervene in times of conflict.
This situation has a depressing effect on the old time idealists. But the Press
Commission has to deal with it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

future of periodical journalism–particularly that section </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of
it which is devoted to Art and Letters and the unbiased study of public
questions–is gloomy. In recent years, several journals </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of
this type have disappeared for lack of financial support. This will affect
adversely the cultural life of the country, and a national Government
interested in culture must come to the rescue of such journals. But if high
standards are to be maintained, the subventions or grants should be “without
any strings,” and similar to </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

way from </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>its subscription and advertisement revenue. And
yet it might up-hold values which are of the utmost significance to the future
of the nation and of humanity. The Commission can suggest ways and means to
strengthen this section of the Indian Press.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was a born poet and artist. Even as a schoolboy, he wrote Telugu verse and drew
pencil sketches of his friends. But it was his college days at Rajahmundry that
formed an important landmark in his career of cultural aspiration and
fulfillment. He came, like other bright young men of his generation, under the
beneficent influence of Principal Oswald Couldrey. This gifted Oxford scholar
perceived intuitively the value of the classic tradition in Indian painting and
sculpture. He sensed, too, the beauty of our folk-songs and popular fairs and
festivals. He enabled his students to cultivate a love of the Beautiful.
Damerla Rama Rao and Adivi Bapiraju were among his favourites. So too were the
cousins, Damerla Venkata Rao and Kavikondala Venkata Rao. Mr. Couldrey took his
students to great centres of Indian Art like Ajanta and Ellora, Sanchi and
Kanchipuram, shaped them into savants and creative artists, and, with
remarkable affection dedicated his ‘South Indian Hours’ to them. Mr. Couldrey
had to resign from the Indian Educational Service all too soon owing to
hardness of hearing. He now lives in retirement in far-away Abingdon,
Berkshire, but once a year the Couldrey Day is celebrated in the Rajahmundry
College with great zeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

this was before the Gandhian movement of 192I. Bapiraju, who had taken his B.A.
degree, was drawn into the national struggle for freedom and went to prison for
an year. Then followed a period of uncertainty as to his future career. I was
then Vice-Principal of the Andhra Jateeya Kalasala (National College) of
Masulipatam, having changed from the profession of Law into Congress
propaganda, then to daily journalism in <i>Swarajya </i>founded by Sri T.
Prakasam, and then again to cultural effort in the Kalasala under the guidance
of Dr. Pattabhi Sitaramayya and Sri Mutnuri Krishna Rao. The idealist-founder
of the Kalasala, Sri Kopalle Hanumantha Rao, was no more, but the Poet Sri
Viswanatha Satyanarayana and the Painter Sri Promode Kumar Chatterjee were my
colleagues. Art-students like Mallaiah, Ram Mohan Sastri, Ananda Mohan Sastri,
and Veluri Ramamurti sat at the feet of Sri Chatterjee. Young Gopala Reddi was
a student of literature and history. One day I thought of Bapiraju and wondered
why he should not be one of us. I invited him for a brief stay during which I
induced him to become a regular student of our Art Section. The management
provided him with a scholarship, and his family and mine shared the same
palmyrah cottage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

vividly I remember those days! Bapiraju and myself felt we were twin-souls,
companions through the ages, destined to share our dreams and our achievements.
The dreams were often shattered, and the achievement hindered, by the continual
struggle against adversity. But throughout our chequered careers extending over
three decades, our mutual love sustained us. We were nearly of the same age; we
pursued different but closely allied paths.<sup>2</sup> Beinng a creative
artist, Bapiraju achieved eminence as a novelist and short-story writer, as
poet and composer of songs, as painter and play-wright, adorning whatever he
touched. He exerted a profound influence by his eloquent speeches on Indian Art
and Literature. I have not risen to those heights. I played the humbler role of
a journalist and friend of </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Russian presence in the Indian Ocean area has become item number one in
discussions on South East Asian security of late. The issue is of particular
relevance to Indian foreign and defence policies. What is the extent of Russian
penetration? What are the motivations behind the Russian presence? And how does
India perceive the presence? These are some of the questions that deserve
attention. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
can be no doubt that the Russian navy is much more active in the Indian Ocean
than it was before. A squadron of the Pacific Fleet consisting of one heavy
cruiser, three destroyers and one guided-missile vessel and other
accompaniments are undertaking regular cruises since 1968 in the area extending
from the Indonesian archipelago in the East to the Cape of Good Hope in the
West. Originally part of the Vladivastok-based Pacific Fleet, the Soviet naval
squadron in the Indian Ocean may have by now become a semi-autonomous tactical
force. The Russians have also been active seeking fuelling facilities, if not
much more, in a number of places along this, route. In the Andaman island
ports, in Western Pakistan, in St. Brandon Islands off Mauritius, and in Sudan,
the Russians have probably obtained such facilities. But reports of the
Russians having gained bases in Indian ports, especially in Visakhapatnam, are
repeatedly and emphatically denied. There is clearly a distinction between
acceding occasional berthing and fuelling facilities and allowing naval bases. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
should also be remembered that the Indian Ocean is a part of the high seas over
which all nations have an inherent right to move freely. Thus, when the Russian
presence is talked about, what one is concerned really about are the
motivations behind this fact, more so because the Russians had been least
active in this region till a short while ago. A whole range of motivations,
starting from the most innocent one of promoting Russian mercantile interests
to the most sinister design of becoming the overlord of the area suggest
themselves. It would be instructive to analyse some of these. Of<i> </i>course,
we can safely assume the Russian naval activity in the Indian Ocean area has
much more to do than the mere promotion of commercial interests. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

a Western observer visualises the present Russian interest in the framework of
the historical Russian attempts at gaining access to the Persian Gulf area (and
from thereon to the Indian Ocean) as also in the context of the Cold War
struggles. Putting these two together they conclude that a new Russian threat
has emerged. It is difficult to dismiss these views outright. For one, the
Russians, the old Czars as well as the new communist leadership, had all along
wanted to gain a footing in the area. For another, the emergence of Africa and
the Arabian Peninsula as the present theatre of competition between the
Russians and the Western powers, taken in the context of the British withdrawal
from these areas, lends added credence to the theory that the Russian naval
presence is a part of the effort to fill the power vacuum in the area. Of<i> </i>course,
even the Chinese confirmed that such indeed are Russian intentions. In May ’69,
Peking’s official daily, <i>Jenmin Jiba </i>charged that “under the guise of
paying visits to Indian naval bases, many warships of the Soviet revisionists
have entered the Indian Ocean to carry out expansionist activities. They are
thinking of filling the vacuum in the Ocean to be left by Britain in order to
build up their sea supremacy from the Black Sea, via the Suez Canal and the
Indian Ocean to the Far East.” As against these it is possible to argue that
while Moscow is certainly after acquiring a military footing, this attempt need
not necessarily be viewed as part of a Russian grand design to dominate and
swallow the powers of this region. The point is that the Russian naval
activity, while certainly being conducive to the extension of great power
rivalry in this area, can also be interpreted in a less dangerous light. After
all, the British and American navies acquired considerable sway in different
parts of the Indian Ocean and why, it can be asked, should one view the Russian
entry with special apprehension. No doubt the less the rivalry the better are
the prospects for peace. And on this basis one would wish that the Russians
have not opted to extend their sphere of activity. But the fact that they had
opted to do so does not necessarily constitute a threat in itself. This view
needs to be canvassed as an alternative way of looking at the issue for there
are strong grounds to believe that motivations other than domination are behind
the Russian move. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

The influence of defence considerations cannot be ignored. It is now well-known
that the Indian Ocean area has a network of American submarine-based missile
systems directed against Russian land targets. A British naval affairs expert,
who is also a lecturer in Soviet studies, admitted recently that “the Soviet
Navy moved reluctantly into the Indian Ocean because it had to, and was
operationally ill-prepared for, such a move. For submarine-based Polaris
missile deployment against Russia, the Arabian Sea is second only to the
Eastern Mediterranean in terms of target coverage; and the area becomes
relatively more attractive as the missile range increases. A 3,000-nautical
mile system would cover almost the whole of China and all the Soviet Union
except the eastern provinces.” It is thus the presence of long-range sea-borne
American weapons systems that accounts for changes in the Soviet Naval
strategy. The Soviet answer to the Western threat is to keep its naval units in
constant motion relying on the freedom of the seas in peace time. Thus it intends
to frustrate the strike capabilities of the American Polaris and Poseidon
missile systems. In this connection the significance of the Anglo-American
agreement over American base in the Chagos group of islands should not be
missed. These islands, Aldabra and Diego Gorcia, are situated midway between
the South African coast and Australia, a thousand miles due south of India.
Under the agreement, in the island of Aldabra a naval base is to be built and
at Diego Garcia a big communications centre with missile tracking devices is to
be established. These proposals were finalised as far back as 1966. This
American base also links the two mammoth communication centres which the
Americans have in Western Australia in the East and in Asmara, in Ethiopia, in
the West. All these could not but have confirmed Russian apprehensions about
the American offensive potential. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Further,
ever since the implementation of the American withdrawal from Vietnam, it is
widely discussed that future American strategy may take the shape of ‘off shore
presence.’ And this would not conflict with President Nixon’s <i>Guam Doctrine </i>under
which Asians are to be left to fight against subversion by themselves. The
Americans might have thought of withdrawing from all land commitments and to
render assistance from outside. For this increased naval involvement would
assume high priority. It cannot be that the Russians are unaware of this
dimension. And not-withstanding the blunting of Cold War rivalries, the
Russians could not but attempt to gain a footing in the Indian Ocean area to
checkmate possible emergence of America as the prime legatee of the British
power. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>(2)
The Russian concern to checkmate the Chinese cannot be underrated either. The
southward thrust of China, the British withdrawal from Singapore, and the
American withdrawal from Vietnam, together confirm the need to contain China in
this region. The Chinese have also been active in establishing close relations
with the Arabian and East African states and their stake in the Indian Ocean
area is only too obvious. Consequently Moscow is as much concerned about this
dimension as with the American dimension. When the Brezhnev proposal for Asian
Security was mooted, Washington is reported to have conceded that Russia was
more interested to prevent Chinese domination than to checkmate el America in
the post-Vietnam era. Thus there is no reason to brush aside the view that
Russia’s Indian Ocean policy has a strong </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

to it too. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Further
there is the view that inter-services rivalries are being keenly fought out in
Moscow. It seems that the navy has to assert itself by making a convincing case
to defend against the Western challenge. Thus the recent Soviet challenge in
the Indian Ocean area is partly “a reflection of the Soviet Navy’s internal
struggle for independence within the Moscow defence establishment. Admiral
Gorshkov has had to fight for his ships’ new oceanic freedom, against
influential strategists who considered that the Navy’s correct role was to be a
faithful helper of the Red Army, largely confined to coastal defence and
support.” Viewed thus the imminence of the Russian threat recedes to a minor
place. Of course, it is unwise to separate economic from political and military
motivations. Yet, the overall evidence does not point to any Russian grand
design to dominate the Indian Ocean area. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

doubt, the foregoing analysis goes contrary to the premise behind the British
policy of arms supplied to South Africa. The Conservative Government bases its
policy on two grounds: (1) that there is a Russian threat which can be met by
strengthening South Africa naval potential and (2) that under the Simonstown
Agreement Britain is obliged to resume arms supplies to South Africa. It can be
shown that both these grounds are baseless. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

The foregoing analysis to a great extent exposes the exaggerated nature of the
views on the Russian naval threat. But more important is the American attitude.
The U. S. A. is clearly against the British resumption of arms supplies to
South Africa. Surely, the Americans are not given to ignoring even a remote
chance of a Russian menace! The present evidence is that the Americans do not
rate the Russian danger to be so great as to warrant resort to so unpalatable a
bargain as an arms deal with South Africa. In fact, the former Labour Defence
Minister Mr. Dennis Healey stated in the House of Commons in July 1970 that the
Russian presence was not seen as a threat either by his military advisers or by
NATO or by U. S. (See <i>British Arms for South Africa </i>by Merle Lipton in <i>The
World Today, </i>London, October, 1970, p. 427) The limited extent of British
assistance, however, makes all mockery of the reasons London is advancing. To
soften the blow to African sentiments, Prime Minister Heath stresses that
Britain would give South Africa only defensive items and replacements. If this
be true, then it is difficult to see in what exact manner the Russian naval
threat, particularly the submarine threat, is supposed to be contained. South
Africa alone can hardly deal with any real Soviet challenge. British aid is too
insignificant to contain the Russian presence but enough to provide racialist
South Africa with more teeth to suppress freedom. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

As regards the Simonstown Agreement, this was the consequence of Britain
relinquishing its naval base at Simonstown, in South Africa, in 1955. Apart
from pledging to supply South Africa with twenty specified warships and a
promise to cooperate in defending the sea lanes around South Africa, there are
no more obligations cast upon Britain. In fact it was this aspect of the
Agreement that made South Africa frequently criticise it as being ‘unequal’ and
unfavourable to her. So, as it is, honouring Simonstown doesn’t involve supply of
arms. That South Africa is demanding arms and would even want Britain to take
her into a defence alliance, like NATO, has no bearing on the terms of the
Simonstown Agreement. Under the pretext of the commercial and strategic
importance of the Cape route, South Africa’s Prime Minister, Voster, wants a
regional alliance, like the NATO, for the defence of South Atlantic and Indian
Ocean areas with white nations like the U. K., Portugal, Australia, New
Zealand, Argentina and Brazil as members. The real purpose is “to commit these
powers to the defence of the present South African Government in the event of
any armed conflict” (Merle Lipton, in the <i>World Today, </i>op. cit. p. 430).
In other words, these nations are to bail out South Africa and its racialist
policies in the event of confrontation with the African nations. <i>There is
thus little thought of safeguarding freedom against communism and much
preoccupation with safeguarding racialism. </i>Even without a larger alliance,
British arms will be put to the same purpose. African nations are convinced
that South Africa would use these weapons to suppress liberals and protest
movements and might even start a pre-emptive expedition against radical black
neighbours like Zambia, and Tanzania. This is the crux of the matter agitating
most of the members of the Commonwealth. It is inconceivable that Britain is
not aware that its arguments are untenable. The Conservative Government is
pledged to its own South African lobby of vested trade and industrial interests
to resume arms supply to South Africa. The influence of certain racialist
backwoodsmen in England sympathising with South Africa’s <i>apartheid </i>is
also evident in recent times. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is also suggested that the effect of arms supply to South Africa would be to
enable her to scuttle a future U. N. economic blockade in support of the U. N’s
anti-apartheid resolutions. Some British commentators had also analysed that
the immediate result of resumption of arms supply would be to frustrate the U.
N. from deciding upon any such blockade. Viewed thus, the British decision is
far more culpable–it is perfidious, for it seeks to frustrate any future U. N.
action over South Africa and possibly over Rhoedisia too. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Indian Government does not feel that the Russian presence is a matter for grave
concern. While it has been rather unduly soft towards Soviet attitudes, in this
instance its reaction seems to square with the facts. Emphatic denial by Prime
Minister Gandhi that no naval bases have been given to Russia shows that India
on the her part has not contributed to the Soviet presence. India also the has
stated categorically that there can be no question of any power vacuum in the
area consequent on the British withdrawal and it certainly does not encourage
any outside power to fill this vacuum. Actually, New Delhi would welcome the
neutralisation of the whole region. But, alas, this can never be accomplished.
The United States since long, and the Soviet Union now, are there. We can only
hope that the shift of the areas of rivalry from Europe to the Indian Ocean
region will slowly die down as the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks succeed. It
is also to be hoped that the Government of India would not further compromise
non-alignment by yielding to possible Russian pressures for the grant of such
concessions which may amount to giving base facilities to the Soviet Navy.
However, there is any amount of need for the Indian Navy to expand and to
become a force in its own region. No stone should be left unturned in
augmenting our naval potential. An active pursuit of co-ordinated effort for
the joint defence of the Indian area by the nations of the region should be
stepped up and the old Indian inhibition that we should strive for co-operation

reasons for Indo-Nepalese frictions apart, it should be realised that, the very
juxtaposition of these powers as neighbours invariably creates tensions. And
remembrance of shared history and culture only makes these worse. The tiny
neighbour is apt to be apprehensive that history and culture only buttress the
Big Brotherly potentialities of its neighbour. Not that these apprehensions are
always justified. The point is that even without expansionist motivations, the
big neighbour is at a disadvantage, and all the more so if it has an image and
reputation for responsible behaviour to safeguard. Psychologically viewing, the
‘ugly American’ has his counterparts in every case of big and small power

India’s part at the turn of events in Nepal could not be concealed. The

wanted an explanation as to what caused this sudden stiffening in Nepal’s

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>While the treaty was to expire by the end of October
1970, negotiations for a fresh agreement commenced in January 1970. But these
failed due to differences between two sides on two important issues. India
wanted: (1) That the concession of free import of Nepalese goods into India
should be specifically limited to goods wholly of Nepalese manufacture and not
to those manufactured with imported raw materials. (2) That of the existing
transit facilities, the direct road link to the East Pakistani border should be
discontinued. Otherwise, India was prepared to continue the existing
concessions. Nepal, on the other hand, insisted that there be no departure from
the erstwhile treaty. The talks ended in a deadlock. Nepal blamed India for the
failure of the negotiations. High level meetings between the Indian Foreign
Minister and the Nepalese King during February 1970 appeared to have restored
cordiality. But, within the few weeks of these the King administered a
gratuitous insult to India by referring to Nepal’s “not getting the usual trade
and transit facilities in accordance with customary international practice”, at
the reception of the visiting dignitaries attending his son’s wedding, and in
the very presence of the Indian President. Mollifying explanation followed from
Nepal. In September, Mrs. Gandhi and King Mahendra met in New Delhi bringing
down the communication barrier at the top. Thus was the ground prepared for the
second round of talks in October 1970. By October 30th, on the very eve of the
expiry of the treaty, it appeared that agreement was reached between the two
sides. But suddenly Nepal terminated the negotiations accusing India of trying
to squeeze Nepalese trade and commercial contracts with the outside world.
India’s reaction was one of pained surprise at the unwarranted harshness of the
Nepalese complaint. Still, India agreed to the continuation of the existing
pattern of trade and transit arrangements as provided for in the expired
treaty, hoping that negotiations would be resumed to hammer out a new treaty.
Even the third round of talks in December 1970 had proved unsuccessful. Nepal
again held India solely responsible for this. What is more, Khatmandu took the
unusual step of complaining to </p>

the trade issue the real difference was over the meaning of the term ‘Nepal-manufactured
goods’, India understanding it as “items wholly manufactured in Nepal.” Her
objection was that importing of goods produced in Nepal with foreign raw
materials free of duty would hurt Indian industry. On the other hand, Nepal’s
case in this aspect rests really on the ground that a small country with a
struggling economy should be shown generosity by the big neighbour. Nepal
cannot say that India is obliged under international law to exempt all Nepal’s
manufactured goods from import duties. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

this facility. India feels that Nepal cannot demand </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>such
facility as a matter of right and hence New Delhi’s unwillingness to
accommodate. It is also a fact that during the past the volume of trade between
Nepal and Pakistan through this route had not been significant. India sees a
political motive in Khatmandu’s insistence on the perpetuation of this
concession. Nepal sought to propagate that India is not even honouring the
Barcelona Convention on the right of land-locked states to access to
neighbouring countries. Nothing could be farther from truth, for the Barcelona
Convention provides the transit facilities be given but does not provide for
the land-locked state choosing her own routes. India had never denied transit
facilities. In fact the operation of the erstwhile treaty more than amply
reveals Indian bona fides and goodwill. For example, Nepal’s trade with third
countries has increased ten-fold from $2 million to $20 million in six years
since 1962 and this could not have happened without the benefits conferred by
transit facilities through India. Again, out of the 8,000 sq. feet of warehouse
facility offered by India at Calcutta Docks, barely an eighth had been used by
Nepal. The most convincing fact of India’s goodwill is that India has waived
last year the storage rent totalling Rs. 57 lakhs that Nepal owed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is rather difficult to fathom Khatmandu’s motivations in playing David’s role
against the alleged Indian Goliath. Possibly the backing of Peking and Pindi
accounts for most of Nepal’s pride. Curiously enough, America too recognised
Chinese special relations with Nepal, thus impliedly encouraging Nepal to stand
up against India. The fact that Nepal’s behaviour showed a marked shift
immediately after Vice-President Agnew’s visit in February 1970 should not be
missed. There is also the possibility that India is being used as a scapegoat
to divert the attention of the Nepalese people from internal troubles.
Strangely enough, the Nepalese Prime Minister had categorically stated that
many of the hostile statements made by Nepalese leaders “were meant for
internal consumption and were not made at India.” This information was given by
Mr. Dinesh Singh, the then Foreign Minister, while speaking to Parliament’s
Consultative Committee of the External Affairs Ministry in February last. (‘The

the Government of India was right in not allowing hurt feelings get the better

phrase always smacked of tutelage rather than interdependence. For example,
both the Secret Protocol of 1950 and the Arms Sale Agreement of 1965 put
restrictions on Nepal’s acquisition from other countries without India’s
concurrence and this, it should be admitted, Nepal could not be expected to
tolerate. India was also wise in conceding to Nepal’s demands over the

Inder Malhotra pointed out: <i>“Nepal’s basic interests in</i> <i>India are

equation, between economic aid and military strings. There is no escape from
this situation in the short run. We cannot appear to be anxious about Nepal’s
defences as that would prove to be counter-productive. While hoping that Nepal
would take proper care of its border in the North, we must realise that the end

Anderson, the novelist <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>par excellence, </i>of
the industrial era in America sounds perfectly contemporaneous to the Indian
reader today, and his easy flowing English style continues to be a source of
relaxation for the tired in mind and spirit. Then, he is something more too, as
he traverses the borderland between prose and verse to explore the psyche
within and makes us face the truth about ourselves. His name is rightly
associated with D. H. Lawrence and Gertrude Stein, for according to Horace
Gregory, “each gives the reader (and beyond this their kinship ends) a vision
usually reserved for readers of poetry alone, a view of life, familiar to be
sure in ‘realistic’ detail, but far more ‘alive’ than the resources of prose
and of fiction commonly permit.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Even in an age dominated
by stalwart literary names, Sherwood Anderson stands out as a popular and
serious writer. In his autobiographical writings and especially in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Winesburg, Ohio, </i>Anderson recorded the
youth of his America with folksy humour and exquisite simplicity. This is
mainly because his own rich inner life flowed into his writings with himself as
the leading personality donning many fictional garbs. This again was due to the
fact that he was the first creative writer to be actively influenced by Freud’s
theories and the interaction of Freudian psychology and creative imagination. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sherwood Anderson was
born on 13th September 1876, the son of a harness-maker and house-painter. One
of seven children, the house was full of laughter and colour in spite of the
declining family fortunes and the emotional problems of one’s childhood
Anderson had no schooling. But his enthusiastic readiness at taking up odd
jobs-newspaper vendor, field hand, stable boy, factory worker–gave him an
education suited to the work he was to take up later, that of a creative
writer. He took part in the Spanish-American War in 1898-’99. After his
discharge became a successful businessman in Ohio and Chicago, got married and began
his writing career as a contributor to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The
Little review. </i>1916 saw the publication of his first novel, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Windy McPherson’s Son. </i>Anderson gained
overwhelming popularity with the novel <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Poor
White </i>which was preceded by the significant volume of tales, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Winesburg, Ohio. </i>He received the Dial
Award <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>in</span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'> </i>1921 and holidayed in Europe. At about this time he also gained
the friendship of literary personalities like Carl Sandburg, Ben Hecht and
William Faulkner. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Dark Laughter </i>was
published in 1925 and earned <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>him</span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>a handsome profit. He began to go on
lecture tours and became a busy journalist. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This bare outline of
dates can be terribly misleading as Anderson’s inner life was a complex
battlefield of warring emotions. He grew up at a time when philosophers like
Thoreau, Ingersoll and Emerson were being absorbed by America’s youth with
eagerness. Then, of course, there was Sigmund Freud. Anderson suffered a
nervous breakdown in 1912 and had himself psycho-analysed. In 1921 he had met
James Joyce and Gertrude Stein who enthused him in the art of digging up the
sub-conscious. The complex shades of his personality flowed into his private
life. He married four times. A good deal of his work is concerned with the
problem of woman and the debasement of sex. His masterpiece, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Death in the Woods </i>crystallises his
lifetime’s experiences and inner struggles in the symbol of the worn-out old
woman found dead in the woods. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“She did not look old,
lying there in that light, frozen and still. One of the men turned her over in
the snow and I saw everything. My body trembled with some strange mystical
feeling and so did my brother’s. It might have been the cold. Neither of us had
ever seen a woman’s body before. It may have been the snow, clinging to the
frozen flesh, that made it look so white and lovely, so like marble.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

debasement of sex in everyday life and overtly sympathising with the lot of
women, he burst a thematic bomb-shell in this short story. Exploring his own
creative methodology here Anderson wrote: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“It seems to me that the
theme of the story is the persistent animal hunger of man. There are these
women who spend their whole lives, rather dumbly, feeding this hunger. For
years I wanted to write this story. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As for the technique, it
was quite definitely thought out...For example, I thought it necessary
to...lift the animal hunger, I wanted to get at, out of the realm of sex.
Therefore my tired out, sexless old woman, the dogs feeding from the food
attached to her body after her own death.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Though Anderson was such
a serious technician at times, his novels appear shapeless. His heroes are like
Ulysses adventuring into new fields of thinking restless with their present
situation. Such a presentation chimed well with an America launched upon the
industrial age with hundreds of small inventors trying their luck and their
fortune, resembling the scramble of the small-scale industry engineer of
today’s India. Of his novels, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Poor <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>White</span></i> brings out this idea best.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Hugh McVey of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Poor White </i>had a penurious childhood with
no home nor education. Just when he was about to become a wastrel, a railway
station came to his town and he got the job of a coolie. A sympathetic
station-master imparted him education, while the station-master’s wife
instilled in him a sense of purpose. Barely turned 20, he went out into the
world giving up his railway job, following the vague dreams that were making
him restless. For three years he wandered about many towns of the Middle West
working as a farm hand in several places and observing the world around him,
until he settled in Bidwell as a telegraph operator. Anderson’s details of
Bidwell’s entry into the industrial age form a massive document of evocative
description. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“And all over the
country, in the towns, the farmhouses, and the growing cities of the new
country, people stirred, and awakened. Thought and poetry died or passed as a
heritage to feeble fawning men who also became servants of the new order.
Serious young men in Bidwell and in other American towns, whose fathers had
walked together on moon-light nights along Turner’s Pike to talk of God, went
away to technical schools.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Hugh too catches the fever and makes a thousand
plans and pours over technical tomes sorting out data. His first invention is a
plant-setting machine, to transplant cabbage seedlings neatly on the field. The
“embroy industrial magnate” Steve Hunter promotes this invention. Soon there is
the town’s first industrial enterprise, the Bidwell Plant-setting Machine
Company. Hugh turns out more inventions such as an apparatus <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>for</span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

epic quality about Anderson’s relentless descriptions of the new age. Here are
breath-taking machines, people grown rich overnight and also the factory
workmen populace, “mice that have come out of the fields to live in houses that
do not belong to them. They live within the dark walls of the houses where only
a dim light penetrates, and so many have come that they grow thin and haggard
with the constant toil of getting food and warmth. Behind the walls the mice
scamper about in droves, and there is much squealing and chattering.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Reading <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Poor White </i>one feels that one is
watching the India of today. Just as the simplicity, vision and trusteeship
slogan of Gandhi have been laid by for industry-oriented thinking and
accumulation of personal wealth for personal ends, the books of Lincoln and
Garfield are not disturbed from their perch in the bookshelves. Instead, the
young men began to read in the newspapers and magazines of men who by
developing their faculty for getting and keeping money had become suddenly and
overwhelmingly rich. Hired writers called these men great, and there was no
maturity of mind in the people with which to combat the force of the statement,
often repeated. Like children the people believed what they were told.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Hugh McVey is a success
story though beset with personal problems of adjustment. He marries Clara
Butterworth, a rich heiress of Bidwell, and all is well. Anderson studies the
growing to maturity of a rich American girl of those days while discussing
Clara Butterworth. He returns to his favourite animal imagery while recording
her thoughts before marrying Hugh, “an honest, powerful horse, a horse that was
humanized by the mysterious, hungering thing that expressed itself through his
eyes.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“If I have to live with
an animal; if as Kate Chanceller once said, we women have to decide what other
animal we are to live with before we can begin being humans, I would rather
live with a strong, kindly horse than a wolf or a wolf-hound, she found herself
thinking.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nevertheless Hugh McVey
turns out to be a satisfactory dreamer-technician-inventor and after an initial
struggle Clara and Hugh manage to make a success of their marriage. They
acquire a car and the town too progresses fast. There is prosperity and also
consequent human tragedies. The rich get richer, the poor become poorer! It is
all so familiar to us. Life goes on and on thus. Anderson does not provide a
solution to the problems of the industrial age in this novel. In his later
novels written after 1925 he attempted to back up the proletarian cause.
Necessarily this dampened his creative exuberance. In 1927 he bought two
newspapers and settled in Virginia to edit them. Anderson passed away in 1941. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

a word about <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Winesburg, Ohio. </i>This
book is a landmark, because it changed the character of American short stories,
from mere realistic reporting to psychological exploration. Realism, whimsy,
humour and compassion are mixed and compounded in the crucible of Anderson’s
imagination, and presented in a prose that is as supple and liquid as verse.
These “intense psychological studies of trapped and warped personalities” were
a direct outcome of his nervous breakdown and hospitalisation in 1912. George
Willard in this collection could be Anderson himself. A part of him is
reflected in Enoch Robinson too. After all Anderson was an expert in tilling
the field of memory. As Horace Gregory points out: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

sources were the air he breathed, childhood memories of talk, of the few books

story-teller’s genius. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

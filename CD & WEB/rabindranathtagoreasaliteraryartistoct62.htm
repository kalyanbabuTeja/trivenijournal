<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Baffling as certainly an <span class=SpellE>endeavour</span>
to provide an exhaustive list of Tagore’s achievements in the various fields
like music, dance, painting, histrionics, education, etc., would be, even the
effort to describe his output within the limited field of literary and poetic
writing would be, difficult. Indeed his contribution to ever so many types and
forms of writing is amazing, if not defying adequate enumeration. As one of his
admirers, the late <span class=SpellE>Mahamahopadhyaya</span> <span
class=SpellE>Harprasada</span> Sastri, said: “He has tried all phases of
literature–couplets, stanzas, short poems, long pieces, short stories, fables,
novels and prose romances, dramas, farces, comedies and tragedies, songs,
opera, <span class=SpellE>Kirtans</span>, <span class=SpellE>Palas</span> and,
last but not least, lyric poems. He has succeeded in every phase of literature
he has touched, but he has succeeded, beyond measure, in the last phase of
literature. His essays are illuminating, his sarcasms biting, his satires
piercing. His estimate of old poets is deeply appreciative, and his grammatical
and lexicographical speculations go further inwards than those of most of us.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
can add to what has been said above, that he has written also much on religious
topics, educational problems, <span class=GramE>social</span> questions, economic
and philosophical speculations and on music. He is reported to be an authority
on metrical forms. He is also one of the most informed of Bengali critics. His
epistolary exuberance is perhaps unrivalled, in his own language, for its
quality, quantity and manner. In his venture on prose poems he has few equals.
His familiarity and real interest in modern science received no greater
satisfaction than in producing a beautiful book upon it by the name of <span
class=SpellE><i>Visva</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>Parichaya</span>. </i>In
the field of writing charades in Bengali he was almost a genius. Dance-plays
were of his <span class=SpellE>favourite</span> creations. Nursery rhymes,
primers for school children, nonsense verses, picture books for youngsters, can
also be added to illustrate the fecundity of his </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>imaginative
writings. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Still,
though <span class=SpellE>Rabindranath’s</span> range is so enviably extensive,
his genius is essentially lyrical. But even the term ‘lyrical’ in his case has
to be taken with a qualification, in that, however much he has given scope to
his personal experience, there is a vast deal more of his output, in which he
has objectively reacted to life. Maybe the lyric is one-pointed at any
particular moment and can be distinguished from the dramatic. In other words,
in some of his moods the author remains intensely aware of one aspect of a
matter which, in such moments, cannot be anything far removed from his own
conception of the Truth. It is in this way Tagore is lyrical. In all his short
stories, essays, dramas, songs, he is taken up with one extremely intimate
theme and is identified with it. One thing is certain and we need not hesitate
to express it, that creativity in literature derives much of its vitality and
sustenance from sincerity of feeling, keenness of insight, skill in delineation
of character, artistry and deftness with which observation is related. Indeed
both lyric and drama trace their sources to one particular individual’s
experience; still they are representative of many other kindred souls that are
dumb of poetic speech. In lyric we perceive, an empathy and identification by
the author with his theme, while in play-writing is visible an amount of
detachment and forbearance of opposition. Call it lyricism or by any other
name, Tagore’s sympathy for all forms of life was real and rich. It looks as if
there is no bit of what he observed in life that could escape his pen. He was
fond of describing himself as only a poet, as if it meant something very
insignificant. But the fact is, to be a poet in his manner is to be
immeasurably great. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
criticism is generally <span class=SpellE>levelled</span> at him that, because
of the large quantity of his writing, he fell a prey to frequent repetition of
some idea or thought in them. True, there is repetition of ideas and situations
as well, occurring in some of his plays and essays. This, to a superficial reader,
may even seem detracting from his originality and freshness. Yet there is not
really so much of it as to deserve criticism. For instance, a few poems may
speak of a strain of melody and the sweet-throated bird that pours it out. But
this does not by itself make all of them same on as repetitions of one single
idea in three succeeding pieces. If scanned with care each will be found to
possess a particular idea, very near what occurs in the three others, yet not
without <span class=GramE>a distinctiveness</span> that makes the difference. <span
class=GramE>Persons</span> who are familiar with <span class=SpellE>Karnatic</span>
music, know that the <span class=SpellE>Sangatis</span> of a <span
class=SpellE>Pallavi</span> of great composers like <span class=SpellE>Thyagayya</span>
often appear as mere repetitions to the uninformed ear, though containing
minute points of elaboration and differentiation, which develop clearly the
growth of the song into a surpassing climax of mood and feeling. Of course to
those who will not undergo the discipline of a seasoned critic, everything will
appear as redundancy of execution and purposeless elaboration. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
can be a further argument as to why at all should any poet worth the name, do
that sort of thing so as to cause strain on the listener or reader to scan
beauty and meaning in them. Well, let us try to comfort such lazy individuals
with the answer, that a writer’s emotions require perhaps more than a couple of
lines similar for gaining his own sense of <span class=SpellE>fulfilment</span>.
The critic also will have to reconcile himself to the fact that he is under no
compulsion to read all of them. Again it may be only on a par with the other
criticism that, had the poet written less, leaving decipherable marks of
excellence on the pathway of his progress, he could have helped a great deal
more for a correct assessment of his art. The answer will readily form on the
lips of the sober among us, that a writer of such overwhelming originality and
fecundity as Tagore cannot restrain his moods of outpouring for the convenience
of the so-called </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>critic. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Apart
from the variety and volume of his works, the artist in Tagore was compounded
of a great deal of knowledge of the fundamentals of philosophy and higher
experience. One may get impatient of admirers of Tagore trying to interpret his
poems and other writings as truly based on a search for Reality. Modesty
impelled the poet to correct his listeners not to mistake him for a regular
student of the systems of philosophy extant. Nevertheless, consistency of
philosophical thought can be found in all his utterances. Art and religion,
according to him, got betrothed to each other long before he ever became aware,
of their existence in himself. True, there is no systematic approach in him to
philosophical speculations of the kind we are familiar with. He never proved
anything as his own precious contribution to philosophy. Still, what he gave
out can strike any thoughtful mind as something very searching and fundamental,
expressed in a way which is again of an unprecedented nature. Even before
reason can be convinced, the heart is ready to receive his message, <span
class=GramE>In</span> the words of <span class=SpellE>Masti</span> <span
class=SpellE>Venkatesa</span> <span class=SpellE>Aiyengar</span>: “It does not
reach the door of Truth by the established path; it makes its own way to it
over the green meadow.” For instance, if he wants to point out death as not so
horrible as to be always avoided, he resorts to the arresting analogy of the
child’s cry when the mother takes it away from the right breast only to place
it the very next moment against her left one, If the poet wished to prove how
much the physical body of man can help or hinder the progress of the soul’s
journey here below, he easily draws the analogy of the road that can be looked
at as connecting one with his destination as well as separating him from his
goal, The same philosophy of the ultimate surviving of the soul alone, after
the physical body gets annihilated, has been convincingly hinted at by the use
of a simile. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
will not be out of place to refer to Tagore’s apt similes. They contain such
beauties of observation and imagination that they are appreciated for
themselves even as <span class=SpellE>Kalidasa’s</span> <span class=SpellE>Upamas</span>
are. One should not fail to note that similes are employed by the first-rate
poets for illuminating or illustrating a thought or idea and never to clog the
reader’s mind or lead him astray. The happy simile will clear up any fog
enshrouding an intricate suggestion or thought. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
proceed further, without indicating at least a few of Tagore’s imageries, would
be like watching the dew-decked rose in the morning without inhaling its
sweetness in the air. Taken at random too, some of his pictures are exquisite.
A lamp fulfils its purpose when the wick burns and consumes the oil. Supposing
it were to happen that in order to conserve the oil the wick should not burn,
it will be like a man of affluence hoarding his wealth and not using it for
beneficial acts of service. If the poet makes <span class=SpellE>Duryodhana</span>,
in his dialogue with his mother, say regarding the duty of a <span
class=SpellE>Kshatriya</span> not to be soft and yielding towards his rivals (<span
class=SpellE>Pandavas</span>) there is pressed into service a beautiful analogy
for bringing out the justice of his argument: “The stars shine in clusters, but
not the sun and moon; the grass grows in amity, but not the giant trees.” No
doubt one may contradict a simile as not functioning completely in its best
service too of clarifying an idea. Then it is for us to <span class=SpellE>realise</span>
that its main function is not to conclude an argument or clinch a point of
view, but only to elucidate it or render it more obvious to the erstwhile
unconvinced mind, <span class=SpellE>Valmiki</span> or Kalidasa alone can stand
a comparison with Tagore in this. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Some
may opine that for the, phenomenal literary achievement of Rabindranath, his
resort to mysticism confines the appeal sometimes, if it does not detract from
his pre-eminent claim to success. There have been instances of persons trying
to spell out significances from titles like <i>The Post Office </i>or <span
class=GramE><i>The</i></span><i> King of The Dark Chamber. </i>Such a tendency
may mislead the ordinary run of the readers and even estrange them from a
proper estimate of the poet. Very often the transition from a shrouded meaning
to obscurity becomes quick. Mysticism is mistaken for a kind of mist
overhanging a poet’s images. Looked at carefully, mysticism of the East is an
age-old habit of many a god-intoxicated soul to express itself in terms of
familiar relationship with the Supreme as Love to Lover or Servant to Master.
The great <span class=SpellE>Alwars</span> and <span class=SpellE>Nayanmars</span>
in Tamil literature are household words for such poetry in <span class=SpellE>excelsis</span>.
<span class=SpellE>Tyagayya</span> of the musical Trinity, in <span
class=SpellE>Kirtana</span> after <span class=SpellE>Kirtana</span> of his,
pleads before the Monarch of his heart, Sri <span class=SpellE>Ramachandra</span>,
for his own liberation, expressing his yearning in ever so many patterns of
imagery likened, unto a novice waiting for the Master-musician, or as the
meanest attendant remaining riveted to his post as a watchman at the gate of
the royal personage. If he so unaffectedly says, <i>“<span class=SpellE>Nannu</span>
<span class=SpellE>Palimpa</span> <span class=SpellE>Nadachivachchitivo</span>,
Na Prana <span class=SpellE>Natha</span>”</i>, Tagore would almost echo the
same sentiment but in his own way thus: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

plaintive outpouring mingled with the purity and excellence of a personal life
is sufficient to stir any listening heart to its core. The best of world’s
mystics have been simple-hearted beings. If parts of the <i>Gitanjali </i>could
have, in the English translation, moved the hearts of foreigners, what effect <span
class=GramE>could they</span> have in the original on his own countrymen of <st1:place
w:st="on">Bengal</st1:place>, one can easily imagine. If imagination can
picture to our minds much in them as capable of reaching most of us of ordinary
understanding, the more cultivated and the better-lived among us cannot be
insensible of the beauties lying hidden in them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tagore
imbibed the best in Indian as well as English literatures. Shakespeare, <span
class=SpellE>Valmiki</span>, Kalidasa, Wordsworth and Shelley influenced his
already prepared mind to receive to its fullest capacity the intimations they
are capable of. In his vast output he combined idealism and realism in such
proportions that ultra-moderns too in the grip of present-day tendencies do not
eschew his novels and stories for their suggestion of higher moral values and
an everlasting life. It will be fruitless to deal individually with even the
best of them here. To be brief, all of them reveal the awakening of his mind in
the stories, and more definitely in his novels. He perceived the motives of
human beings in their pursuits and conflicts and viewed with insight the
complications in the resulting situations of life; and nothing struck him as
trivial or insignificant. Stones and streams converse with him. Skeletons and
ghosts carry messages to his heart. The variegated fare that he, as a result of
his observations, provides us is, for a single writer, simply breath-taking.
The lyrical elements that he often introduces in his stories are by themselves
precious treasures. Each one of us may have his or her own preferences among
his stories, but all of us are agreed that they all, without any exception,
portray life in its dismal crevices as well as enlivening situations often
missed by us. <i>Eyesore, </i>newly christened as <span class=SpellE><i>Binodini</i></span><i>,
</i>was his first long story. But even after many of his later novels like <i>The
Home and the World, <span class=SpellE>Gora</span>, </i>etc., became well known,
its psychological presentation has its unique appeal to us. For being an early
attempt, it is not lacking in execution or conceit. Maybe some of the
characters in anyone of his novels return to visit us in another of his
creations, such as <span class=SpellE>Annapurna</span> tracing her prototype in
<span class=SpellE>Sucharita’s</span> aunt in <span class=SpellE><i>Gora</i></span><i>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Another
criticism against Tagore is that he has not portrayed the lowest rung of
society. Really good criticism will only take into consideration, in assessing
the work of a literary artist, whether there is skill in narrative, suspense
and gripping elements in situation, truthfulness in portraiture of men and
women, and power and beauty in description. These and more will always be
evident in any of Tagore’s works. One thing must be said for him, and that is,
despite his reformist tendencies, he never shut his mind altogether to
conservatism and orthodoxy. His <span class=SpellE><i>Gora</i></span><i> </i>effectively
proves how he can view old-world notions of right and wrong in society with
sympathy and understanding. Another feature of his writings is that, in spite
of his patriotism and love of his race and people, he cannot for one moment
forget to <span class=SpellE>emphasise</span> universal love and a brotherhood
as essential to our growth. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

course it cannot be ignored that, however much Tagore is in his true element
both in his short stories and novels, his short stories maintain a more even
quality of excellence than his longer stories. One occasionally perceives
structural weakness and looseness of situation in some of his novels. The
powerful influence of Nature finds adequate treatment in his stories, and the
supernatural element also finds a place in the dispensations of his.
Nevertheless, the psychological results emanating from them do not appear at
all as far-fetched or improbable in any great degree. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tagore
in his <i>Religion of the Artist </i>has indicated his disapproval of the
devices employed by modern writers to create sensation by presenting
abnormalities. The surprise-tricks and suspense-tricks that we perceive in
serial novels of the journals were to him anathema. The present-day
preoccupation with sex-problems and totally physical treatment of love cannot
he said to be quite <span class=SpellE>unfamilar</span> to him, though in his
own way he shows self-restraint and grit from ever sliding down to indecency.
His capacity for arresting descriptions, his highly cultivated sensitiveness to
beauty and penetrating analysis of the relationship between human beings, have,
all brought us a wealth of felicity derivable from </span><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
aspect of life which has engrossed him, as perhaps none else, is his treatment
of child psychology. The innocence and harmless curiosity of the young touch
him, and his fertile imagination supplies in its turn a pile of images of the
child as it plays, imagines, creates, destroys, builds and tries to perpetuate
itself. Not one but many instances will have to be given here, if I were to
expatiate upon them. So I will desist from the task. In song, story and satire
the child has been captured in all its artificiality defying moods and habits. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

play of feeling as distinguished from action is characteristic of his dramas.
Here too, essentially, the musical quality predominates and distinguishes his
achievements. But symbolical representation of ideas is not without
significance to Tagore lovers. His dance-dramas are some of his
peak-achievements in stage production. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

upon his dramas, one has to reckon with his mordant <span class=SpellE>humour</span>
and wit. Detachment, which is the seat of rich <span class=SpellE>humour</span>,
can be proved in his case more effectively, perhaps, than in any other known
writer. Writing of his early attempt at poetry in his <i>Reminiscences, </i>he
refers to the fate of his poetry receiving sound knocks and beatings from all
and sundry just as a thief, caught red-handed in his childhood days in his
house, had to receive severe <span class=SpellE>belabouring</span> from every
passer-by. Speaking of an incident that took place in his house when a <span
class=SpellE>planchette</span> was used to converse with the spirit-world, he
relevantly reports that an old dead servant of theirs was interviewed and when
queried as to what he was at that moment after death, replied thus: “I will not
tell you. Why should you learn so easily what I had to die to learn?” We are in
paroxysms of laughter at that. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

which is employed primarily to cause mirth and secondarily to persuade the
reader to the author’s point of view, has one of its great exponents in Tagore.
The other day Mr. <span class=SpellE>Aldous</span> Huxley deplored, at the
Tagore Seminar, that satires, which are of immense values and the tests of the
skill in a writer, are on the wane now-a-days. There is much truth in what he
said, if only we <span class=SpellE>realise</span> its purpose after such a
feast as the <i>Parrot’s Training </i>provides us. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

indigenous culture were predominant in him, though he never eschewed good
influences from any other source. He assimilated whatever was beneficial from
the West and showed no trace of irreconcilables in his mental make-up. Maybe
some of his writings have given room for some to think he was more western in
his attitudes. Westerners too have made the same mistake in imagining that he
was actuated in many of his songs by the influence of Christianity. In one of
his delightful sayings in <i>Stray Birds </i>he perhaps suggests the
unnecessary attempt of people to arrogate to themselves credit for the merit in
others, thus: “The night opens the buds and leaves to the morning to receive
the thanks.” Yes, people forget that the personality that he developed in the
course of his eighty years was not the outcome of any particular influence
alone. Born in affluence and in a cultured home, he naturally added to it
layers of refinement of his own seeking. Simplicity and ingenuousness proved of
more help to him in his sympathies with all creation. Intimacy with life and
nature sustained him in his appreciation of his surroundings wherever he might
be. It is only when one is lacking in the riches of experience that he resorts
to artificiality and devices of prickly surprises in writing. Sorrows of a
domestic nature did not bend him; exaltations of spirit never dislocated him.
He retained to the last the cream of a wide understanding, which is the key to
all his literary productions. If life could give of its abundance to anyone, it
was to Tagore, whose identification with every bit of humanity and nature
augmented his potentiality for doing <span class=GramE>good</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

paths, <span class=GramE>both tradition</span> and modernism, both conservatism

result was a balanced and harmonious blend of mind. He touched nothing which he

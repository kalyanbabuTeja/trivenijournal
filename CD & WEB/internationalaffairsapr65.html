<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>On the 1st of January the Home Minister declared
that the “Left” Communist Party had been formed under <st1:country-region
w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>’s inspiration in order to promote her
designs against <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
On the 3rd, <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region> protested
to <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> against alleged
border violations in the <span class=SpellE>neighbourhood</span> of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Sikkim</span></st1:country-region>; this was done,
apparently, to forestall <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>’s
protests against actual border violations by <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>. On the 4th, the Premier of
Malaysia appealed for help against attacks from <st1:country-region w:st="on">Indonesia</st1:country-region>,
which were expected to increase on the departure of that country from the
United Nations, due a few days later; in fact, small attacks have continued,
over the frontier in Borneo, and from the sea upon <st1:place w:st="on">Malaya</st1:place>.
On the 5th, the American President declared his readiness to resist the
aggressive activities promoted by <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>,
in particular in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">South
  Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>. On the 6th, the Indian National
Congress discussed the proposal to make nuclear weapons in order to <span
class=SpellE>neutralise</span> those of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>. On the 7th, <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Indonesia</st1:country-region> left the U. N., and it was later
announced that, together with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and some small countries, she intended to form a rival organisation. After a
pause in January, <st1:country-region w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region>
resumed her attacks on the Indian frontier, and in February and March increased
them to a pitch never previously attained; the President of Pakistan visited
Peking in March, and a number of other consultations took place; these attacks
are attributed to encouragement from <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
 w:st="on">China</st1:country-region></st1:place>. </p>

is the centre of most of the aggression in the world today. If her policy were
peaceful, there would still be friction between <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
and <st1:country-region w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region>, and between
North and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">South Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
but these disputes would have no more than local importance. As it is; they
form parts of a pattern which appears ever more menacing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>These
somewhat diverse movements, which are rallying to <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>
or being exploited by her, have in common a frustrated nationalism resembling
that in <st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place> in the interwar period, which
expresses itself in dictatorship at home and aggression abroad. An alliance
between this spirit and that of communism is not very difficult. In fact the
communism of <st1:country-region w:st="on">Russia</st1:country-region> includes
an element of this kind, and that of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region> is at least strongly
nationalistic. Their common enemy is liberalism, constitutionalism, <span
class=GramE>the</span> bourgeois spirit. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Several
of the leaders of the Indonesian nationalist movement were liberals, though
they professed socialism, but President <span class=SpellE>Soekarno</span> has
suppressed them or reduced them to insignificance. He maintains his power by
appeals to an unthinking nationalistic militancy which seems to flourish on the
frustration produced by his own total failure as a constructive statesman. The
Communist Party of Indonesia finds this situation congenial, and it is now the
strongest party in the country and is represented in the Government. Its
leaders have contrived to keep on good terms with <span class=SpellE>Soekarno</span>,
in the expectation that on his departure, power will fall to them without much
difficulty. In this situation it is natural that Mr. <span class=SpellE>Aidit</span>,
the Party Secretary, should expound his party policy in reformist terms, but
while we should hope for the best we should not attach any importance to these
pronouncements. The Indonesian Communist Party supports <st1:country-region
w:st="on">China</st1:country-region> in opposition to <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region>, and is
probably an important channel of Chinese influence on the Indonesian
Government. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>President
<span class=SpellE>Soekarno</span> maintains his power by stimulating
nationalistic excitement. For several years this was directed mainly against
the Dutch colony of <st1:place w:st="on">West <span class=SpellE>Irian</span></st1:place>.
<st1:country-region w:st="on">Indonesia</st1:country-region>’s claim to the
area was doubtful, but in the hope of coming to terms with the nationalism of
the under-developed countries, <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>
supported it. In 1962 <st1:country-region w:st="on">Indonesia</st1:country-region>
took over West <span class=SpellE>Irian</span>, but instead of </span><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Her
complaint is that the policy of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Malaysia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is “neo-colonialist”. The treaty between Britain and Malaysia provides for
bases which Britain may use in order to keep the peace in the area; and further,
when Indonesia proposed to eliminate the neo-colonialist influence through a
confederation of the two Malay countries with the Philippines, it came to
nothing because, she suspects, of pressure from Britain. There are, however,
substantial reasons for <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Malaysia</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
coolness towards the proposal of confederation. Her standard of living is high
and rising, whereas that of <st1:country-region w:st="on">Indonesia</st1:country-region>
is low and falling; and after years of warfare against the communist guerillas,
<st1:country-region w:st="on">Malaysia</st1:country-region> is strongly opposed
to communism, whereas <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Indonesia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is likely very soon to become a communist state. In this situation <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Malaysia</st1:country-region> seems to feel safer with British bases
in her territory, and this is more especially so as her experience of
colonialism (there was no conquest: in Malay the Sultans asked for British
protection) has left little hostility to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
attitude of Indonesia towards colonialism and its supposed resurrection is
different, but it may be suspected that her accusations against Malaysia, a
country one-tenth of her size, are a pretext rather than the real ground of her
announced and active, though technically undeclared, war. Still less do these
accusations explain her decision to leave the U. N. and join <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region> in
forming a rival organisation. This seems to commit her to <st1:country-region
w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>’s world revolution, in which <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Indonesia</st1:place></st1:country-region> could
hope for no more than the severely qualified independence of a communist
country of the second rank in the highly <span class=SpellE>centralised</span>
order which the great powers would try to impose. The puzzle would be solved
if, like Fidel Castro, <span class=SpellE>Soekarno</span> had been a secret
communist all the way through, but it is clear that he is not. The truth seems
to be that he is a victim of the frustrated nationalism which he himself has
done so much to propagate. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Though
her background is very different, the policy of <st1:country-region w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region>
is beginning to show an ominous resemblance to that of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Indonesia</st1:place></st1:country-region>. The
leaders of <st1:country-region w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region> were far
less involved in anti-Western nationalism than those of <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>, and still less than those of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Indonesia</st1:place></st1:country-region>. They
supported <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>
during the Second World War, whereas the Indian leaders supported the Quit
India campaign and the I. N. A.–for which the British have never quite forgiven
them. The support of the British officials in <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>,
thus obtained, was necessary to achieve the separation of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>. The
new state soon became a formal ally of the Western Powers, and has received
much economic aid, which has not been wholly wasted. Partly because of this
background, and partly because they regarded her claim to Kashmir as just (this
is a tenable view: the present writer, for one, has always held it), the
Western Powers have consistently supported <st1:country-region w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region>’s
case in <st1:place w:st="on">Kashmir</st1:place>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
after a few years it became clear that diplomatic support and U. N. majorities
were not going to change the position of <st1:place w:st="on">Kashmir</st1:place>.
The subject then became an obsession, and <st1:country-region w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region>
turned in desperation to <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>:
At first the idea was merely to threaten <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>,
and when in 1959 <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>’s
ambitions in this direction were revealed, <st1:country-region w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region>
offered <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
a settlement, including joint <span class=SpellE>defence</span> arrangements.
But Nehru appears to have felt sure that however much his policy might
exasperate the Western Powers, they would never tolerate the subjugation of
India by a communist power, Accordingly he could afford to ignore Pakistan’s
hostility, even in combination with China’s, and he rejected President <span
class=SpellE>Ayub</span> Khan’s offer. <st1:country-region w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region>
therefore turned again to <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>,
and she has become more and more reckless in supporting <st1:country-region
w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>’s policies and in attacking <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. In the
campaign before the election at the beginning of January, both the candidates
appear to have thought it advisable to show hostility to <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
principal cause of <st1:country-region w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region>’s
irrational <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span> is her failure to gain control
of <st1:place w:st="on">Kashmir</st1:place>. As a consequence of this
disappointment she seems to be adopting the frustrated nationalism shown by
other ex-colonial or under-developed countries. It inclines towards the
illusion of power conferred by dictatorship, and the exhibitionism of an
arrogant, aggressive foreign policy. It has been plausibly compared to the
attitude of the adolescent boy (in western society), in rebellion against his
family and all its traditions and principles, doing all he can to shock the
staid old <span class=SpellE>fogeys</span>, threatening to leave home and join
a criminal gang, but yet dependent upon the family and still further
exasperated by his dependence. If this analogy has any validity, it can be said
that <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>’s policy towards <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region> has
failed through indecision. She might have averted this development entirely by
genuine appeasement in regard to Kashmir, or she might have knocked sense into <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s head
by firmly suppressing her tantrums. <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> did neither, and now has a
confirmed delinquent on her hands. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the alternatives of abandoning <st1:country-region w:st="on">South Vietnam</st1:country-region>

the election campaign the large staffs of the Russian and Chinese Embassies were
very active and circulated much propaganda material. The chief opposition
party, the United National Party, in its campaign, strongly opposed Marxian
ideas and the former Government’s communist alignment. The result was a defeat
for the Government and a victory for the U. N. P., which with the support of
the parties representing the Tamils and other groups, has a substantial
majority and has formed a Government. The comparatively well educated and well
informed public of Ceylon appear to have judged, as a result of experience,
that socialistic economic policies and association with the communist countries
are less advantageous than the former policies and associations, with all their
imperial and snobbish overtones. The self-destructive, hypertrophied nationalism
which is now so common among former colonies is not universal. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

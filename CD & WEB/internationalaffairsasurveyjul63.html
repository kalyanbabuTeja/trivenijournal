style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the quarter under review two events have been considered as of major
importance. One is the conclusion of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty by the <st1:country-region
w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region w:st="on">Britain</st1:country-region>
and Soviet Russia; and the other is the widening of the ideological rift
between Soviet Russia and Communist China in consequence of the failure of the
talks between them at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City>.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
estimating the importance of the Test Ban Treaty it is necessary to understand
clearly what it proposes to do and what it does not. What it proposes to do is
to prohibit nuclear tests in the atmosphere, in outer space and under water. It
does not prohibit underground tests. It is therefore not a total but only a
partial ban on tests that the treaty provides for. A total ban was not found
possible because while violations in the atmosphere, in outer space and under
water can be discovered without on-the-spot inspection such an inspection is
necessary in the case of violations underground; and Soviet Russia is not yet
prepared to permit such on-the-spot inspections. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
treaty also suffers from other limitations. Any nation signing the treaty is
given the right to withdraw from it after giving three months notice in advance
if it considers that by adhering to it its supreme interests are jeopardised.
Secondly it does not prohibit the production of nuclear weapons and making
additions to the existing nuclear stockpiles. Thirdly it does not prohibit the
use of nuclear weapons in future wars. The danger of nuclear warfare continues,
in spite of the treaty. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
spite of these limitations the treaty has a large amount of importance
primarily because it is the first time within eight years that there is an
accord between the East and the West which have been engaged in a cold war for
about seventeen years. Eight years ago they agreed on the terms of the Austrian
treaty but on every other question which they subsequently discussed they could
not arrive at any compromise. The conclusion of this new treaty is the first
step in the march towards the abandoning of the cold war atmosphere and towards
world peace. It is the first step that is always the most difficult one. Now
that it is taken, it gives a sort of guarantee that other steps would be taken
to solve through peaceful negotiation other questions at issue between them. As
President Kennedy has put it, “This treaty is not the millennium. It will not
resolve all conflicts or cause the communists to forego their ambitions or
eliminate the dangers of war….But it is an important first step–a step towards
peace–a step towards reason–a step away from war.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
treaty also secures some other advantages. Nuclear tests are costly and their
prohibition releases large amount of funds for being spent on peaceful
pursuits. These tests also cause the pollution of the atmosphere through their
radioactive fall out. Though it is possible to reduce the fallout no process
has yet been discovered to bring about its complete disappearance and the fall
out has been found to cause cancer in the bones, Leukemia in blood and poison
in the lungs. The danger of such fall out is all the greater as the new nations
like <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region> which are anxious
to become nuclear powers are not acquainted with all the latest scientific
processes by which advanced nations like the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region> and Soviet Russia
have been able to reduce it. A third advantage which the treaty may hope to
secure that it can serve as a check to the spread of nuclear weapons to nations
who do not now possess them. It is expected that other nations will become
parties to the treaty. <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
has already agreed to sign it. The force of world opinion will compel other
nations who are in a position to become nuclear powers–nations like <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>, Italy
etc.–to adhere to the treaty. So far it is only <st1:country-region w:st="on">France</st1:country-region>
and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
that have opposed the treaty. It is much more dangerous to have nuclear weapons
distributed among a dozen nations than among two or three. There is a greater
danger in that case of one nation or another acting in an irresponsible manner
and starting a nuclear war. The treaty prevents it to a large extent. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
question is asked by several people why both President Kennedy and Premier
Khrushchev were anxious to conclude a treaty like this now, while they failed
to do so in the past. This is not the first time that attempts at a limited
test ban were made. The conditions now were however more auspicious than at any
other time. Khrushchev especially was in need of such a treaty so that he might
demonstrate to his critics at home and to his Chinese critics that the policy
of co-existence is practicable. Moreover he wanted to make peace with the West
so that he might be more free to deal with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region> which became his enemy number
1. De-Stalinization also raised high expectations among the masses of people in
Soviet Russia. They were now demanding more consumers’ goods and a higher
standard of life. The new generation had not the same revolutionary fervour as
the old. All this demanded a reduction in expenditure on armaments and the test
ban treaty was naturally looked upon as a real step in that direction.
President Kennedy was eager to respond to him. In American interests, as well
as in the interests of world peace, it was necessary to strengthen the hands of
Khrushchev in his ideological war with Communist China and break the monolithic
structure of the International Communist Party. These were some of the
circumstances that made possible the conclusion of the test ban treaty at the
present juncture. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is thus clear that there is some connection between the treaty and the
ideological war between Soviet Russia and Communist China to which we have now
to turn our attention. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
point which requires to be noted in connection with the dispute between <st1:City
w:st="on">Moscow</st1:City> and <st1:place w:st="on">Peking</st1:place> is that
it is only partly ideological. To a greater extent it is due to divergent
national interests. Ideologically the Chinese regard themselves as the true
exponents Marxism-Leninism and dub Khrushchev and those who follow Russian
school of thought as revisionists. To the Chinese the only way by which
communism could be spread throughout the world is through a policy of war with
capitalist and feudal states. Peace with them is unthinkable to the Chinese. It<b>
</b>may be that today the capitalist nations led by the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
are militarily stronger than the communist powers. This does not mean in the
Chinese view that the latter should make peace with them. On the other hand
they must build up their armaments, work in close co-operation among themselves
so that in due course the manpower of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region> supplemented by the
scientific resources of Soviet Russia might be in a position to carry on a war
to the finish with the capitalists, destroy them and make the world safe for
communism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It is to this view that Khrushchev is opposed. It is
his conviction as well as that of a majority of Soviet leaders that war today
with a capitalist power like the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region> is bound to be a
nuclear war and that such a war would be suicidal. What is the kind of
communism, he asks, which can be built after the destruction of hundreds of
millions of people in the United States and Soviet Russia along with their
cities, their industrial centres and their agricultural farms and with the
radio-active fall out causing ruin to the people in every part of the globe? We
should think therefore of discovering peaceful means of spreading communism and
we have to accept meanwhile the principle of peaceful co-existence as the only
principle for regulating relations between states with different political and
social systems. Marxism is a religious creed and like all religious creeds it
has developed sectarian differences, differences like those of Hinayana and
Mahayana in Buddhism, Sunni and Shia in Islam, and Catholicism and
Protestantism in Christianity. There is no possibility of resolving such
differences and it is no wonder that the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City>
talks between the representatives of the Soviet and the Chinese interpretation
of Marxism failed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the differences between the two are not merely ideological. Their national interests
have become divergent. A strong and powerful <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region> is bound to prove a menace to
Soviet Russia. <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region> has a
claim to large areas of Siberia and Central Asia which are now in possession of
<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
has a population of seven hundred millions and outlets are needed for them. The
vacant spaces of <st1:place w:st="on">Siberia</st1:place> are most alluring to
them. It is the realisation tahat a strong China–especially with the
revolutionary militancy which now characterises her present rulers–will be a
source of ultimate to Soviet Russia that has been responsible for the cooling
of relations between the two countries. Even those Soviet leaders who do not
agree with Khrushchev in all matters of domestic and foreign policy are at one
with him in thinking that <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
poses a threat to their nation’s interests. This accounts for the withdrawal of
Soviet aid to China, the recall of Soviet technicians from that country, the
continuous diminutions in trade between them and the refusal of Soviet Russia
to help China in her attempts to occupy the off shore islands, to give atomic
weapons to her or to back her in her border dispute with India. The failure of
the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City>
talks only show how serious the differences are and it is now becoming clearer
that they are even unbridgeable. Nationalism is a stronger force than
communism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Chinese use ideological arguments because it serves their purposes. From their
point of view a nuclear war might destroy Soviet Russia but this will ensure
her leadership in the communist world. Even if several millions of her own
population die in such a war there will be a sufficiently large number of
survivors who can help their country to become the greatest power on earth. It
is this nationalism that makes her argue that Soviet Russia should not extend
economic or military aid to<i> </i>a bourgeoise country like <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. It is
this that has made her enter into a defence pact with <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>, a
non-communist dictatorial state. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>From
the long period point of view of world peace and stability the rift between
Soviet Russia and Communist China is welcome. A monolithic communist bloc
extending from the Baltic the Pacific can exercise tyranny over the whole
world. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
rift between the two communist states is part of a break up of the alliances
which came into existence in the years following the Second World War. The
world then became divided two blocs–the Soviet and the American–each opposed to
other and each building up alliances with other states to strengthen itself.
The NATO and the Warsaw Pact states in Europe, and the SEATO in <st1:place
w:st="on">South-East Asia</st1:place> were such alliances. Now that the cold
war between the two shows signs of disappearing, the alliances are becoming
looser. Among the Warsaw Pact states <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Rumania</st1:place></st1:country-region> has shown open resentment
towards Soviet Russia. She doesn’t want to remain a purely
raw-material-producing state. She is anxious to become industrialised. All this
is opposed to the principle of complementary economics on which the Warsaw Pact
is built. She is also supporting <st1:country-region w:st="on">Albania</st1:country-region>
and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in the ideological war. Communist Parties in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Hungary</st1:place></st1:country-region> and other satellite states
are also demanding a relaxation of Soviet hold over them as the price for
supporting Khrushchev in the ideological war. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the American bloc also similar loosening is making its appearance. De Gaulle of
<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">France</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is determined on following an independent line of his own. He has withdrawn his
naval forces from the Atlantic alliance and entered into a separate pact with <st1:country-region

He does not want <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>

a statement which Ambassador Chester Bowles made at his first Press conference
in New Delhi he said: “The world has arrived, it seems to me, at a kind of
watershed between the two eras–with all the uncertainties that such a watershed
suggests. Although the full dimensions of the new era are still largely
obscure, one thing at least is certain. In such a period it is inevitable that
India and the United States will be going through a period of adjustment which
will call for great patience and understanding on the part of all of us.” The
struggle between Soviet Russia and the United States has become less important.
There is a possibility of a no-war pact between the NATO and the Warsaw Pact
states and both the blocs working closer together in an attempt to contain
Communist China. India also should now follow a bolder and more dynamic policy
towards the same purpose and enter into a closer working partnership with the
United States and Soviet Russia in arresting Chinese expansionism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>One other event of importance in the quarter is the
holding of the conference of the Heads of thirty independent States in Africa
at Addis Ababa the capital of Ethiopia, the oldest state in the continent. This
opened a new chapter in the history of Africa. The division of the independent
states into a Casablanca group and a Mourovia bloc was hailed and all the
states were now prepared to work in concert to solve their common problems. One
such problem was the ending of colonialism in the Continent and of Apartheid in
South Africa. Measures were taken against both Portugal which is now the only
important colonial power in the Continent and also against South Africa. It now
looks certain that within a short period of time Angola and Mozambique will
become free. Even South Africa may be compelled by action here and at the
United Nations to revise her Apartheid policy. The non-White races are no
longer in a mood to tolerate the White domination. </p>

is from this standpoint that the recent incidents in the United States where
the Negroes are adopting the Gandhian strategy of non-violent demonstration to
achieve their rights as American citizens are of great significance. The
Negroes in that country number 19 millions in a population of about 180
millions. Though as a result of the great Civil War fought a century ago they
were emancipated from slavery and granted by an amendment to the Constitution
all rights of citizenship they have in practice been treated as second class
citizens especially in the Southern States, the original home of slavery. Their
position as regards seggregation and the denial of equal economic and
educational opportunities is much worse than that of our Harijans before 1947.
While we have been doing everything to remove in India the evil of
untouchability and to improve their social and economic position, nothing like
that has been done in the United States. Conditions have not appreciably
improved. Hence their revolt today. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Kennedy has come forward with a Bill, guaranteeing to them equal civil rights
with the Whites. It is now left to the Congress to take action on it. Apart
from it what the situation requires is the multiplication of schools into which
Negro children can be admitted alongside of White children, equal facilities
for vocational training, and equal admission to all jobs. More jobs have to be
created for them, more houses have to be built and more slums have to be
cleared. All this has to be done as rapidly as possible. Otherwise there is a
danger of the extremist elements gaining control of the situation and
non-violence giving place to violence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>One should welcome the attempts that are being made
to proclaim the Federation of Malaysia on August 31. It will for the present
consist of Malaya, Singapore, Sarawak and North Borneo. Brunie which is another
State in Borneo, now a colonial possession of Britain may join later. The
Federation will have a population of ten millions, nearly half of them being
Chinese. President Sukarno of Indonesia is opposed to the formation of the
Federation as it would deprive him of the opportunity to include the northern
part of Borneo in the Indonesian State. He insists on a referendum being taken
in North Borneo and Sarawak before they are included in the Federation. This
position is an unreasonable one. In the case of West Irian which has been
recently made a part of Indonesia no such referendum was taken. It is to be
hoped that he will not insist on this procedure and allow the new state to come
into existence. Its value will greatly lie in its becoming a bulwark against
Chinese expansionism in South-East Asia.</p>

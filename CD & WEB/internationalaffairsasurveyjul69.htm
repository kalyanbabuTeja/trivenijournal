<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>A solution to the problem is nowhere in sight and
frequent engagements still <span class=GramE>remind</span> the world of the
explosiveness of the situation. Since last March no less than half-a-dozen
engagements of considerable magnitude took place. Truly had an American
cartoonist remarked that the June ’67, ‘six-day war is over 700 days old!’ Yet
it is chastening to look at the U. S.-Russian efforts in this area, if only to <span
class=SpellE>realise</span> that both sides are sincere in their efforts for
concerted action for peace in the area. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It is well-known that the four major powers evolved
a plan for <st1:place w:st="on">West Asia</st1:place>. This plan was itself the
product of intense initial negotiations between Washington and Moscow with the
Security Council Resolution of November ’67 as the basic guide line, The U. S.
came out with a plan in March last with proposal for Israeli troop withdrawal
from occupied Arab areas and assuring Israel of ‘secure and <span class=SpellE>recognised</span>
boundaries’, and providing for free transit for Israeli ships in the Suez
Canal. A demilitarized zone in the <st1:place w:st="on">Sinai Peninsula</st1:place>
and a new U. N. military force to separate the combatants and keep peace were
the other important items of the American <span class=GramE>Plan</span>. The
whole arrangement, the Americans insisted, should go through as a contractual
agreement, implying thereby that the Arab States must sign a Peace with <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>–a
condition to which the Arabs have been intensely averse. While this condition
remained a bitter pill for the Arabs, the advance in the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U. S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> position
lay in the fact that it <span class=GramE>ask</span> for a total withdrawal of
Israeli troops from former Arab areas–a proposal disliked by Tel Aviv. In fact
this was to establish the American <span class=SpellE>bonafides</span> <span
class=SpellE>vis-a-vis</span> the Arabs. </p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>,
though showing the usual reticence in approving of the Plan, did not reject it
outright. The Russian leaders themselves proposed, earlier in December’ 68,
that a West Asian peace should be the result of a ‘peace document’ and
strangely enough, hinted at its preference for the presence of the U. N. troops
in area–an arrangement to which they had opposed strongly till then. Thus,
there has of<i> </i>late been a welcome convergence of <st1:City w:st="on">Moscow</st1:City>’s
and <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Washington</st1:place></st1:State>’s
attitudes to the problem. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

for the two belligerent sides themselves, <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region> had opposed the big-power
effort to solve the problem. President Nasser did not commit himself to the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U. S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> proposals
at the start. But a statement he made to the effect that “<st1:country-region
w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region> must accept a package deal embodying all
points of the U. N. Security Council resolution, if they want to gain access to
the <st1:place w:st="on">Suez Canal</st1:place>” implied a great deal. For one,
it clearly envisaged <st1:place w:st="on">Nasser</st1:place>’s readiness to
allow Israeli ships into the canal and for <span class=GramE>another,</span>
its conditions were not too far removed from those of the U. S. Plan. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
bridging of the gap between Arab sentiment and American king was apparently
reinforced with the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U. S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
announcement of for the solution of the refugee problem. Hitherto, <st1:State
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Washington</st1:place></st1:State> had opted to
keep silent over the problem of 1.3 million Arab refugees, which obviously
constituted a major dimension of the larger problem. In April last, <st1:State
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Washington</st1:place></st1:State> proposed that
the refugees given a choice, between repatriation to their former homes or
compensation for resettlement, as part of the over all West Asian deal. It was
reported that the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U. S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
was even prepared to foot a substantial part of the Bill. The fact that this
proposal was made by the Asst. Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, Mr.
Joseph <span class=SpellE>Sisco</span>, at a meeting of the American Israeli
Public Affairs Committee, indicates <st1:State w:st="on">Washington</st1:State>’s
readiness to talk plain with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
which was none too happy with the big-power efforts for a settlement. In the
context of this, the American problem for a general settlement assumes added
significance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
American <span class=GramE>Plan</span> became, as it were, the basis for the
big-power plan. The Russian Foreign Minister, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Andrei</span>
<span class=SpellE>Gromyko</span>, was <span class=SpellE>despatched</span>
post-haste to <st1:City w:st="on">Cairo</st1:City> (while the Communist summit
was still under way at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City>).
Ostensibly, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Gromyko</span> went to discuss a number of
problems of interest to the United Arab Republic and the Soviet Union; in
reality he went to persuade <st1:place w:st="on">Nasser</st1:place> to accept
the big-power proposals. It is highly significant that on the eve of his visit,
<i>Pravda </i>of Moscow came out with an article denouncing in pungent terms
‘nationalists and <span class=SpellE>revanchists</span>’ in Egypt, who are
demanding Arab military action to recover territories occupied by Israel.
Obviously, <st1:City w:st="on">Moscow</st1:City> was setting the scene for <span
class=SpellE>Gromyko’s</span> pressures on <st1:place w:st="on">Nasser</st1:place>.
A more determined disposition on the part of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place

efforts is hard to find. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
substance of the big-power plan lay in a formula evolved between <st1:State
w:st="on">Washington</st1:State> and <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City>.
The formula, which was never made public, was reported to have envisaged (1)
retention by <st1:country-region w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region> of the
Old City of Jerusalem, with concessions to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Jordan</st1:place></st1:country-region>. (2) Israeli occupation of
the Golan Heights (formerly of <st1:country-region w:st="on">Syria</st1:country-region>)
till <st1:country-region w:st="on">Syria</st1:country-region> <span
class=SpellE>recognised</span> that United Nations resolution of November, ’67,
(3) Israeli withdrawal from the <st1:place w:st="on">Sinai Peninsula</st1:place>.
In certain respects it was less <span class=SpellE>favourable</span> to the
Arabs than the U. S. Plan of March, but it should be remembered that the former
was general in nature and the big-power proposals were the result of the
adjustments made to the U. S. Plan to suit conflicting claims in particular
matters. In so far as these involved the Arabs losing the Old City of
Jerusalem, these fell foul with the Arabs, who were determined not to surrender
an inch of territory to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Yet, <span class=SpellE>Gromyko</span> hoped to extract this concession from <st1:place
w:st="on">Nasser</st1:place>. And he failed. Obviously, the Arabs refused to
yield and started accusing <st1:City w:st="on">Moscow</st1:City> of betraying
Arab interests by identifying itself with <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Washington</st1:place></st1:State>. And it could not be expected
that <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City>
would allow its public image of being the champion of Arab interests to be
exposed, even if it did really attempt compromising the optimum of Arab
demands. It is this that explains why after four days of futile efforts at <span
class=GramE>persuasion,</span> <span class=SpellE>Gromyko</span> reverted to
the patent Russian public stance of full support to the Arab cause, demanding
that <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>
should forthwith withdraw from all Arab areas occupied since June 1969 War.
This, no doubt, points out to the limits of East-West collaboration. The point
is that, given the best disposition on the part of these major powers to settle
their differences, they cannot go beyond a certain point in committing
themselves on behalf of their ‘<span class=SpellE>proteges</span>’. Strangely
enough, there seem to be better prospects for agreement between the big-powers
over issues directly involving themselves than over those involving the claims
of their ‘<span class=SpellE>proteges</span>’. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

failure of the <span class=SpellE>Gromyko</span> mission should not, however,
detract from the significance of the Russo-American action in trying for a West
Asian settlement<i>. </i>It provides the satisfying thought that the ‘detente’,
after all, has come to stay. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

gave a propaganda advantage to Saigon and <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place

w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hanoi</st1:place></st1:City> and the N. L. F.
announced a Plan (known as the ten-point plan) at the Paris Conference table,
which envisaged, among other things, the constitution of a coalition government
immediately; the holding of free elections; and the ultimate formation of a
representative coalition. The most surprising part of the Plan is its implied
recognition of the presence of North Vietnamese troops in the South. The Plan
mentioned that the issue of the presence of other armed forces could be tackled
by a more representative government than the present one. The implication that <st1:City
w:st="on">Hanoi</st1:City> would withdraw its men after the establishment of a
coalition in <st1:place w:st="on">Saigon</st1:place> is thus clear. And, this
in itself signifies a great shift in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hanoi</st1:place></st1:City>’s
stand. For, till, then, vehement disclaimers of the presence of its forces were
its refrain at the near comic-opera style of negotiations at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place

been there in the recent <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hanoi</st1:place></st1:City>
moves. But this Plan was promptly rejected by <st1:place w:st="on">Saigon</st1:place>.
The <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U. S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
reacted to this Plan with a counter-plan, which Mr. Nixon laid out on the 14th
of May. This eight-point plan, stressed more the procedures for the withdrawal
of foreign forces from South Vietnam; the appointment of an international body
to arrange for the supervision of the resulting cease-fire agreements, and for
the holding of free elections as soon as the first two conditions were met. The
Nixon Plan envisaged that any participation of the N. L. F. in the Government
should <span class=SpellE>materialise</span> only as a result of the free
elections proposed. In other words, there could be no question of the N. L. F.
being admitted into a coalition in the immediate future as demanded by Hanoi
under the ten-point Plan. Obviously, this crucial withholding of N. L. F’s
participation in Saigon’s Government promoted Hanoi to reject the U. S. Plan.
Yet, it was reported that Hanoi did show a great deal of interest in the
American proposals through private diplomatic channels. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
little later, Saigon, which had all along rejected the Hanoi proposals, grew
even more flexible in announcing that she would never agree to a coalition with
the Vietcong. Though, apparently, the ‘never’ referred to an immediate
coalition, and not the possibility of long-term coalition, the tenor of
Saigon’s refusal suggested a significant step back from its previous offer of
allowing the Vietcong a political role. In fact, it was widely reported that
there was a clash between Nixon and <span class=SpellE>Thieu</span>, In view of
the fact that the Nixon Plan did <span class=SpellE>visualise</span> a
coalition coming about after the proposed elections, the Nixon-<span
class=SpellE>Thieu</span> quarrel arose from the former objecting to any
coalition at all. Seen thus, President <span class=SpellE>Thieu</span>
accomplished a political somersault indeed. Reports of a Nixon-<span
class=SpellE>Thieu</span> split gained added credibility when Nixon proposed a
meeting with his South Vietnamese counterpart at Midway Islands in the Pacific.
President <span class=SpellE>Thieu</span> sought clarifications on the Nixon
proposals of May l4th especially on the issue relating to future elections.
Presumably, he was worried about the implications of the Washington Plan. It is
difficult to say what exactly happened at Midway, but Nixon came out of it with
the announcement of a partial U. S. troop withdrawal, immediately after the
meeting. Though the number to be withdrawn was just 25,000 out of a total of
5,38,500 U. S. soldiers out there, even that is most significant. For,
hitherto, the U. S. refused to consider such a step on the plea that it was for
Hanoi to reciprocate Washington’s first step in stopping bombing raids in the
North. That the U. S. chose to take this further step in deescalating the
Vietnam war without waiting for Hanoi’s gesture is a measure of her sincerity
in trying to end the tragedy there. As if to meet Saigon’s fears of being left
alone to face Communist aggression, President Nixon repeatedly assured that the
U. S. would keep its pledges of supporting Saigon and that the ‘withdrawal’
could always be reversed if the situation so warranted. He proposed a continuing
review of the situation. In spite of these, <span class=SpellE>Thieu</span>
could not have welcomed the American proposals. It is a safe guess that
President Nixon had to concede something to get Saigon reconciled to his
decision. And the concession seems to lie in letting <span class=SpellE>Thieu</span>
talk tough about future elections and about the prospect of a coalition. This
is evident in the latter’s references about elections. President <span
class=SpellE>Thieu</span> merely stated that if the enemy would talk seriously
and show good-will for peace “he would be willing to discuss when and how
elections might be held.” On the issue of a coalition in the short run, the
President’s statements are indeed provocative. He stated “from now on, those
who spread <span class=SpellE>rumours</span> that there will be a coalition
government in the country, wherever they may be, whether they may be in the
executive or the legislature, will be severely punished.” Thus, the price for
the U. S. decision to withdraw is to let <span class=SpellE>Thieu</span> get
away with his rejection of an immediate coalition. The U. S. position <span
class=SpellE>vis-a-vis</span> Saigon is, in a sense, comparable, to Moscow’s <span
class=SpellE>vis-a-vis</span> Cairo, over the West Asian affair. Over Vietnam
it was Washington’s turn to have failed in persuading its ‘<span class=SpellE>protege</span>’
to be more accommodative over the coalition issue, as it was Moscow’s misf</span><span

to have failed in convincing the Arabs to accept the big-power </span><span

Newspapers definitely expected out of the Midway meeting something spectacular
by way of Nixon <span class=SpellE>moulding</span> <span class=SpellE>Thieu</span>
to a more reasonable frame of mind apropos a viable political settlement in the
near future. Judged from these expectations Midway had not seen much headway.

Midway decision was dismissed as a propaganda gimmick by the N. L. F.
Obviously, what irked it most was that the U. S. decision was coupled with
Saigon’s total rejection of any political participation of the N. L. F. in the
near future. As a result, the N. L. F. proclaimed itself as the Provisional
Government of South Vietnam getting immediate recognition from the Communist
bloc, as also from some of the Afro-Asian group. Countries like India chose not
to <span class=SpellE>recognise</span> the revolutionary government. No
material alteration in the situation occurred by this Communist move except
that, at the Paris Conference table the name of the N. L. F. delegation, from
henceforth will be different. No doubt, to some extent, it gets the status of a
parallel government, a status enough to spite the Saigon Government for its
refusal to treat the N. L. F. as representing even a considerable section of
the South Vietnamese. The Americans have also very prudently let the change
take place without any sharp rejoinder at the Paris table. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

measure of the influence he wielded and the affection he commanded in the party
and outside that the Russians took so long to get him out. Like all ‘realist’

of<i> </i>carrying out the ‘diktat’ of the overlord while trying to salvage,

indeed. Originally, the Russian leaders intended to censure China but in the

they had to drop the item from the agenda to get the conference held at all.
But as the conference progressed the anti-Chinese mood suddenly flared up as

the Russians did score a point in another area. They managed to get a majority

relating to the item: “unity in the struggle against imperialism.” The point
about this document is that while it does not specifically endorse the infamous
<span class=SpellE>Brezhnev</span> thesis of limited sovereignty, with which
the Kremlin sought to justify the Czech invasion of last August, it contains
the sinister implication. The <span class=SpellE>Brezhnev</span> declaration
announced: “…..when external and internal forces hostile to socialism try to
turn </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;font-family:

security of the socialist commonwealth as a whole, this is no longer merely a
problem for that country’s people, but a common problem – a concern of all
socialist countries.” Reading this along with the ominous phrase, “the<i> </i>international
duty of Communists,” which comes in the document on “unity,” the sinister
implications of the letter become evident. This cannot but be regarded as a
warning that Russia might not do to other socialist countries what it did to
the Czechs. Thus, plainly, the Russians, given up whatever inhibition they may
have had (since the days of de-<span class=SpellE>Stalinisation</span>) about

sorts. The Kremlin leaders ardently wished and surely expected that the
document would receive the unanimous imprimatur of the conference. In the
event, it was approved of only by a majority–albeit a large majority. That the
apparently innocuous words of the document might conceal frightening potentialities
was made plain by its critics. One delegate stated it in so many words when he
denounced that the document “does not say clearly that each communist party
should have the right to judge and decide for itself when internal questions
are at stake.” It is even more noteworthy that the discussions over the
document should occasion a reopening of the debate over the Moscow-led Czech

come out with the conclusion that there is a right about turn in the Kremlin’s
policies under <span class=SpellE>Brezhnev</span> and <span class=SpellE>Kosygin</span>.
Mr. <span class=SpellE>Anatole</span> <span class=SpellE>Shub</span> of the <i>Washington

struggle in the Kremlin is one between ‘moderates’ and ‘conservatives.’ It is
much nearer the truth, says, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Shub</span>, to say that
there is in-fighting amongst the conservatives and reactionaries themselves.

implications of which suggest that only a conservative and reactionary team
could have taken such a plunge. He contrasts the liberal foreign policy of the

write-up on the leadership of <span class=SpellE>Brezhnev</span>. Referring to
the recent summit and the passing of the document on unity, it says: “It is too
simple to say that the post-<span class=SpellE>Krushchev</span> regime in
Russia has reverted to the habits of Stalinism. The Romans, after their
relative relaxation under Claudius, did not get a return to <span class=SpellE>tiberianism</span>.
They got Nero. Mr. <span class=SpellE>Brezhnev’s</span> Russia has much in
common with Nero’s Rome: not least in the fact that the dominant interest of
its ruler has become the preservation of an impossibly inflexible
power-structure.” Very powerful indictment indeed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

two assessments given above confirming the trend towards neo-Stalinism, can be
accepted only in so far as they relate to Moscow’s attitude towards other
communist countries. If, however, these Western perceptions imply a general
switch back in the foreign policy style of Russia then, serious objections crop
up. For, in fact, in recent times Russian foreign policy has taken to
unorthodox ways, departing even from basic principles of communist ideology.
Witness the most surprising proposal to come out of the Kremlin: the proposal
for creation of a <span class=SpellE>defence</span> alliance for the balance of
power in South-East Asia. Even if Moscow did not envisage <span class=SpellE>defence</span>
pact aimed at encircling China, the very suggestion that some South-East Asian
countries, particularly India, Pakistan, Cambodia and some others, should join
in a collective security arrangement, indicates that the Kremlin does not feel
inhibitions any longer to don the mantle of the supervisor of the world order,
eager to see that no maverick</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

river, to the North of <span class=SpellE>Vladivostok</span>. For quite
sometime there has been persistent haggling, as to whom these border areas
belong. Under the treaty of 1860, the Chinese were made to give away large
chunks of these area, as also other territories on their Western borders (<span
class=SpellE>Sinkiang</span>), to the Russians. It is well-known that the
Chinese were compelled to sign many such treaties with the European powers </span><span

10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>invariably to the detriment of China, and
hence <span class=SpellE>characterised</span> the ‘unequal’ treaties. That
Communist Russia should continue to profit from these unscrupulous gains by the
hated <span class=SpellE>Tzars</span> is certainly ironical. The Chinese now
demand that the Russians vacate these regions. Tension on these regions has
been mounting proportionate to the intensification of the Sino-Soviet cold war,
and on previous occasions border patrols did confront each other in menacing
postures. But never before last March, these confrontations result in armed
clashes involving <span class=SpellE>casualities</span>. But in these recent
clashes, it seems, it is not the Chinese who were in the wrong, for the site of
the engagement was on the Chinese side of the <span class=SpellE>Ussuri</span>
river. Whether the Chinese provoked the Russians to enter into Chinese soil,
one cannot say. The Russians alleged such provocation while the latter accused
the Russians of starting the trouble first. That both the sides chose to make a
public issue out of it is even more significant. Some analysts read in this an
attempt on Mao’s part to reinsure his claims over these areas. It should be
mentioned that negotiations over the border claims ended in failure in 1964.
Apparently, the Chinese say that the Russians have not only been in illegal
possession of their lands but have been indulging in pro­vocative actions. It
will be remembered that this is but a carbon copy of Peking’s explanation over
its hostilities against India in 1962. Thus the Chinese do not distinguish the
Russians from the Indians as far as border claims go. The March clashes were
followed </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;

Russian anxiety to preserve peace in this area also underlies the other
proposal to strengthen regional economic co-operation. This was Mr. <span

and Afghanistan. His suggestion that consultations between Russia, India,
Pakistan and Afghanistan should immediately be initiated for the opening up of
an overland trade route between these countries is of great import. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is also curious that the U. S. A. and Russia should show equal concern for
South-East Asian security, knowing full well that it is not their rivalry that
is likely to disturb the peace. Now that they have decided to withdraw from
Vietnam, the Americans are eager to leave behind a compact alliance to contain
China. The Russian design for collective security in the area, can be read as
no less motivated by an identical concern. No wonder the Chinese had burst
forth into a blaze of picturesque indignation at the Russian proposal. They
called it “the Soviet revisionist attempt to rig up a system of collective
security in Asia” based on an idea “picked from the garbage-heap of the
notorious war monger John Foster Dulles.” Even if one rejects the Chinese
charge, the transformation of Russian policy from ideological considerations to
considerations of power-politics cannot be denied. Time was when Moscow in its
role as the leader of the Communist world refused to think in terms of balance
of power, had little time to think about the security of non-Communist <span
class=SpellE>neighbours</span> and, above all, thought it a sacrilege even to
dream of containing an ‘ideological ally.’ Apparently, the Kremlin has now shed
these norms. In a sense this change could be seen in Kremlin’s role over the
Indo-<span class=SpellE>pakistani</span> hostilities in 1965. Tashkent showed
that apart from the Chinese angle, the simple desire to maintain peace in the
sub-continent became the concern of Russia. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

vagueness of the proposals is indicative of a deliberate decision to withhold
elucidation until the reaction of Asian capitals is carefully sifted. On the
face of it a mere look at the names of the countries mentioned in the <span

Indian Government’s reaction to these proposals is consistent with its previous
stand on the issue. It is opposed to joining any military alliances–American or
Russian sponsored–and has politely expressed its opposition to a military
security system. To proposals for regional economic security, New Delhi reacted
with alacrity. In fact, long before the Russian plan was canvassed, India
started cultivating better relations with East Asian countries. While India, no
doubt, is concerned with Chinese expansionism, as much as any other power in
the area, her search for allies is restricted to alliances in the non-military
spheres. Mrs. Gandhi’s recent visit to Japan and Indonesia is an effort in this
direction. Japan’s attitude, in particular, seems to augur well. Prime Minister
Sato is opposed to committing his country to any military arrangement and he
has openly differed with the United States’ efforts in giving ASPAC (Asian and
Pacific Council) a military orientation. Yet, Tokyo knows full well the need
for non-Communist Asian powers to team together. The obvious alternative, then,
is co-operation in the technical and economic areas. All the same, on closer
analysis, it is doubtful whether intimate economic ties could be a real answer
to external military threats from a strong power. It is all very well to talk
of self-reliance but if self-reliance to be backed by an inarticulate major
promise of outside help, is worth asking the question whether such self-reliance
is more prudent than committal to a long-term military alliance. Perhaps, Mrs.
Gandhi herself was thinking of closer economic ties as capable of bringing
together countries psychologically together and thus paving the way for
bilateral agreements even over <span class=SpellE>defence</span> matters. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>If, without actually colluding, Russia and America
are working for an identical goal: that of containing China–this very same
motivation is leading them to woo Pakistan in a manner causing grave concern to
India. The Russian policy in this regard is extremely interesting. In deciding
to supply arms to <span class=SpellE>Pindi</span> she has put India and
Pakistan on parity in her estimates. In his recent visit to the sub-continent
Mr. <span class=SpellE>Kosygin</span> exhibited how necessary it is for him to
keep <span class=SpellE>Pindi</span> in good <span class=SpellE>humour</span>.
To top it all, Moscow announced that she no longer regards Pakistan as aligned
to the West, meaning thereby that the latter is as much non-aligned as India
is. The reason for this is not too far to seek. Even though General <span
class=SpellE>Yahya</span> Khan did not show a pro-Chinese zeal immediately
after assuming office, this cautious mood has disappeared of late. <span
class=SpellE>Pindi</span>–Peking contacts have been growing rapidly and the
Russians are anxious to do something to restrain <span class=SpellE>Pindi</span>.
Hence the Russian anxiety to appease Pakistan. The Americans have been pursuing
since a long time a policy of not hurting Pakistani feelings. No wonder that
Washington has so far refused to firmly commit herself not to resume the supply
of arms to <span class=SpellE>Pindi</span>. Thus the curious situation of
Pakistan remaining very close to Peking and still getting arms from Moscow and
Washington–remains unaltered to the great chagrin of India. Delhi’s persuasions
in this regard have singularly failed. The super-powers have apparently
forgotten that Pakistan might in a fit of bravado smash the fragile structure
of peace erected in the sub-continent since Tashkent. As for Peking, she is
eagerly waiting for this prospect. </p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>T.
S. Eliot (1888-1965) was a dramatist even before he wrote any play. Though he
had started his career as a poet he was preoccupied with the need for poetic
drama in the post-war world. He set himself to analyse the plays of the
Elizabethans and the Jacobeans in the early twenties and thus to understand why
the plays of Webster, Marston, Dekker etc., lacked the charm and appeal of
Shakespeare. Compared with these masters the dramatists of the later period
looked pigmies. While studying them he was trying to feel the pulse of the
drama and was, as a matter of fact, preparing himself mentally to launch upon
the career of a cautious and conscientious playwright. It seemed to him that
what he thought he was unable to express in poetry, he could present through a
dramatic situation. He knew ‘The tendency of prose drama is to emphasize the
ephemeral and superficial; if we want to get at the permanent and universal we
tend to express ourselves in verse (‘Dialogue on Dramatic poetry’, <i>Selected
Essays, </i>p-46). And this was enough to instill confidence in him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
a decade-long preparation Eliot wrote <i>Sweeney Agonistes</i> (1928) which he
could not complete. Sweeney is a typical ordinary man seeking sensuous
pleasures and comforts. As he lives on the surface he has not fathomed the
agonies of the modern man. Not that he lacked spiritual insights, but now he
does not realise them. Now he is hollow and forsaken. The plants of his
spiritual experiences have dried up on the <i>waste land </i>of this age. Like <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Milton</st1:place></st1:City>’s <i>Samson
Azonistes </i>he has experienced death in life and has found life in death.
‘Sweeney’ has been occupying the mind of Eliot for many years before coming to
its own in this play. One can see the figure of Sweeney taking shape through </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
poems–‘Sweeney Erect’, ‘Sweeney among the Nightingales’, ‘</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Eliot’s Sunday Morning Service’ and ‘The Waste Land’. As his attitude is
rational and secular, Sweeney knows that the Sabbath is </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>necessary
for relaxation after a week’s work. No religious sanctity attaches (and there
is no need for it) to such prescriptions of the Church. He drinks much and does
not care for the opinion of the world which believes in decorum and restraint.
He blurts out whatever comes to his mind but strangely enough his speech is
never without a pattern. One can see his disillusionment in his statement that <o:p></o:p></span></p>

whether the girl was dead and that man was alive, or he was dead and she was
alive, or both were dead, or both were alive. If he was dead, the rent
collector and the milk man were alive, and if they were alive, then definitely
he was dead. As the world depends much for its safety on the elimination of
Sweeney-like people, it was inevitable that in his death exulted the people who
accept the ideals and notions that please them, and not those which show them
the reality behind the reality. Whatever the significance of his experiences,
Sweeney was unable to express them effectively. He failed to convince the audience
of his convictions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Called
upon by E. Martin, Eliot wrote his next pageant play, <i>The Rock </i>(1934)
for a specific purpose, i. e., to raise money for the erection of a Church. It
is somewhat puzzling to think how devoted the playwright was in this kind of
work. Though a Catholic he took this work on himself more on philosophical
grounds than on religious. In a modern city like <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">London</st1:place></st1:City> if a Church is to be founded, should
it be taken as a heap of bricks and stones? If Churches are built and their
need is felt even today, it is because ‘our lime present is time past’. The
foundations of the Church are laid on a rock which is indestructible. To
suggest impersonality seven men and ten women come with half-masks on their
faces. In the beginning the chorus discusses our ‘knowledge of words and
ignorance of the word’ and thereby highlights the spiritual illness of the
present times. By and by the Rock, in the role of a character, led by a boy
comes to export the audience to strengthen its will-power. Contrasted with this
class of people who believe in religion and think that without Churches their
religion will crumble, are presented the workers who, unconcerned with the
‘why’, go on doing the day’s work for their livelihood. The Churches have
fallen, no doubt, but not as a result of the onslaughts of political or
non-religious forces, but as they have grown weak from within. It is these
Churches which, Eliot says, will lead him on to light and freedom– <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of a play. The joints are clearly visible, and the chorus has not risen above
the voice of the playwright himself. There is no harmony between the thought
and the action of the play. The next play <i>Murder in</i> <i>the Cathedral </i>(1935)
was also written on commission for those people who had gone in all seriousness
to the Canterbury Cathedral to observe the martyr’s day of St. Thomas Becket.
Eliot knew, they could ‘put up with poetry’ if he gave them, as they were the
elite and the enlightened few, who would be the last persons to raise
objections to the homage may be in poetry, paid to the revered martyr. The
playwright took advantage of this situation and made use of poetry to the
fullest extent. It is with this play that the true poetic play dates its
revival. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

this play again the playwright takes the same issue for discussion: the place
of the priest in the world. As a matter of fact this is the central problem
with which Eliot seems to be pre-occupied in all his plays (despite the
difference in setting and circumstances). St. Thomas Becket had renounced
political power for the Archbishop’s job for he knew that separation from God
and faith in any other power would mean degradation and death. The whole
atmosphere was charged with danger. On one hand when efforts were being made to
drag him into the quagmire of politics, on the other hand, some lackeys were
out to declare him a rebel. In such circumstances how far was it desirable and
practicable to stick to his standpoint? He had four big temptations–his
glorious past, when he had spent many a carefree evening doing boating; his
days of power, when people readily followed his policies (he could enjoy that
distinction just for his asking); his patriotism; he could prove his salt by
joining hands with his government against King Henry; lastly, the strongest and
the most charming argument was his renown after death. If he could die for the
Church and for his principles he could be an immortal martyr in the annals of
the world. It is the saints and the martyrs that rule the world from their
tombs. It is to them that people in thousands and lakhs go to pay homage, and
not the King. He was unable to take a decision soon. It was only after he had
given the sermon (in which he gave expression to his own conflict that he felt
relieved of the obsession. Now he was ready neither to court nor to escape
death. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

this play poetry dominates, and the conflict is more mental than physical.
Probably, by concentrating on the mental conflicts of Backet the playwright has
tried to suggest that Lord Jesus also had the same conflicts before renouncing
pelf and power to spread the message of God. On this score only is the fourth
temptation more significant than the others. But at the end of the play the
Knights come to justify the murder of Becket and occupy the stage for quite a
long time. It may have served to present the opinion of the aristocrats, but it
fails to fit in the structure of the play. By stressing the secular and
diplomatic need of the day it, perhaps, showed the contrast between the
nobility of Becket’s soul and the grossness of the Knights; but the fact remains
that it was dramatically unnecessary. It was a repetition of what was already
spoken by them while arguing with Becket. These Knights symbolise the political
and secular power which has always been trying to stifle the divine messages of
the martyrgs, but has not succeeded in extirpating the institution of the
Church. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<i>Murder in the Cathedral </i>was successfully acted and it appealed to the
contemporary opinion, it failed to satisfy the dramatist. Eliot confessed that
with this play he had entered into a blind alley. He had made use of the chorus
in these plays, but now he felt that the use of the chorus was desirable only
in cases where the story was mythological or legendary. It would look
ridiculous to put in a play of modern setting a chorus to chant poetry and
philosophise upon the events and incidents. He, therefore, decided to use
certain new techniques in his next play <i>The Family Reunion </i>(1939).
Though he could not do away with the chorus even in this play he was successful
in giving the language a contemporary tinge and peel off the rhetorical
vesture. It was necessary, though, that he diluted poetry and brought speech
nearer to the common man; he could do so only at the cost of the poetry. This
process continued so long that in the last play <i>The Elder Statesman </i>(1958)
poetry is hardly visible. He has always wanted to give expression to the
conflict of modern life, and at the altar of this aim he has sacrificed the
best asset of his plays, that is, even the poetry which was mainly responsible
for the appeal of <i>Murder in the Cathedral. <o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

in ‘Eumenides’ (the third part of Aeschylus’s <i>Oresteia) </i>Orestes had to
face the Furies, here in <i>The Family Reunion </i>Harry Monchensy felt
obsessed with the thought of murder. Orestes had murdered his mother who, in
league with her lover, had plotted the murder of her loving husband Agamemnon.
How far was he justified in his action? None could decide, and consequently, in
the meeting convened by Goddess Athene votes were cast by the mortals as well
as the immortals, and at the end it was found that the consensus of opinion was
in favour of Orestes (though the votes cast were approximately equal on both
sides). In Eliot’s play, Harry’s wife had fallen into the sea and died a
natural death, but ever since, he had smarted under the illusion that he was
the cause of her death. If he had not thrown her into the sea, he had not done
also, anything to save her. Was it so because he had wished her death?
Guilt-ridden he felt so nervous that he could not stand the comforts, of
Wishwood where his mother had planned everything to suit his taste, temperament
and the needs. She had brought up Mary, his cousin only for him, and in her
marriage she was going to see the consummation of her desires. This was to be
the true ‘family reunion’ she had contemplated. During the winter season,
everything was cold and dull, and her son’s arrival after eight long years was

came guilt-ridden and forlorn. His mother and his aunt knew that his destiny
lay in the search for spiritual peace. He also knew that his illness was worse
than he had imagined. It was neither his conscience nor his mind that was
diseased, rather, it was the world in which he was born to live. Even Mary’s love,
the only solace to his broken heart, could not take him out of the limbo of
moroseness in which he had thrown himself. It was only after his aunt had told
him, how his father also had suffered the same pangs of agony, and had
experienced the same guilt, that he regained his vitality. In love with his
aunt his father had wished the death of his pregnant mother. He realised, to
his consolation, that it was the inherited guilt of his father, not his own,
that had tortured him so long. What his aunt had said was perhaps correct: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

may be added here that this play is patterned on Euripides’s <i>Alcestis. </i>Like
Heracles who brought the husband of Alcestis back from the grave, Reilly
successfully planned to give Lavinia a psychological insight into her
limitations and thus to retrieve her from the clutches of frustrations and give
her back to her husband. If Alcestis had chosen to die for the happiness of her
husband Lavinia had decided to leave her husband alone to allow him time to
think whether he could live without her. In both cases it was found that the
union of the husband and wife was necessary for their happiness. The
distinctive feature of Eliot’s drama is that it gives an elaborate analysis of
the motives of the couple and ultimately proves that freedom from the sense of
loneliness is possible only through understanding and living together. The
fourth play <i>The Confidential Clerk </i>(1953) is based on Euripides’s <i>Ion.
</i>Colby had inherited love for music from his father who had died an immature
death, and was at no cost prepared to sacrifice his instinct for music for Sir
Claude. Claude had rejected the profession of his choice to take to the
financier’s job. He had earned name and money but in the eyes of Colby he had
not done the right thing. One should follow the call of instinct and not the
path of success. Colby would be satisfied as a second rate musician but would
resign definitely, howsoever lucrative, the job of the confidential clerk. When
alone he was content to be in the garden of his heart hearing the compositions
of his masters, but Lucasta the daughter of Sir Claude had never felt secure in

he had become himself’, and immediately after this realisation he found that
not only his children but even the blackmailers were happy. He established
himself at the end of the play as a man of feelings. The life of the statesman
he had lived was a mask he had put on for worldly success; but it was done only
after he had taken a decision to bury his true self. It is with the force of
love, he realised, that the life runs and in the absence of which we are bound
to be ‘alone together’. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Eliot has been mainly concerned, in his plays, with religion, especially the
importance of sin and expiation. He took up the central problem of society for analysis
and found that man can never feel secure till he has accepted the destiny.
All–Becket, Harry, Edward, Colby, and Claverton–all these characters find peace
and solace only after they accept what is ordained for them by God. The plays
of Eliot, therefore, should not be studied in isolation: each one stresses an
aspect and all together reflect upon his approach to the spiritual crisis man
is facing today. Our burden is heavy; whether the sin is ours or our
grandfather’s, we all are suffering from guilt. Our modern sciences are not
enough to cure us of this malaise: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is of the great handicaps of religious institutions and Mutts in this ancient
land that these seats of spiritual solace and guidance fall often to partisan
spirits. In this, perhaps, it shares the tendency of all institutions, whether
religious or otherwise, which are independent of popular judgment. No doubt in
a profession of a highly competitive nature as the legal or medical, the best
talent never fails of recognition, if once it can secure the appreciation and confidence
of the public. But if it happens to be a writer or an artist of authentic merit
and originality, the Academies too will not show any real enthusiasm or haste
to choose him as their leader. They may either give him lukewarm praise or
render help to him grudgingly and that too of necessity, but they will reserve
their prizes and awards only for those who share their views on art and
literature and have no independent minds of their own. The same is true of
religious institutions, and never more true than in times of waning faiths and
wavering allegiances. The fact that the highest recognition of any leader lies
in the wide publicity he receives in the press today, may not affect the claim
to acceptance from a vast mass of followers, which sometimes a great teacher
may be able to achieve. For ultimately all true acceptance of leadership comes
from within and not from external compulsion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
can certainly instance the truth of it by the case of the Acharyaswami of
Kamakotipeetam. If Advaitic thought and pure Hinduism has an exemplary
representative in these days, it is the Jagadguru, Sri Sankaracharya of Kanchi
Kamakotipeetam–a saint who, more than anyone else, has given fresh impetus and
direction to the spiritual upsurge of the times. There are others, no doubt,
whose humanitarianism is no less than his; but there have been few in whom it
is so informed by true Hindu ideals, so much emancipated from grooves of
narrowness and in whom it has glowed with such a steady light. To know him, to
come under the magnetic influence of his large, lustrous, benediction-shedding
eyes, is to feel existence at its purest and best. It is to pass into the
Kingdom of God. The mental poise that comes to us very occasionally, the faith
that easily dries up in us, are in him ever in an increasing measure and
advancing the cause of others. His emotions are under strict control and never
allowed to impress the sentimental and the sanctimonious; but they are never
stifled, for they are completely transmuted by the superior wisdom inherited by
him from a line of great Acharyas who had adorned the seat, in order to infuse
continuity and purpose to the energies they generate. Precept and practice are
so proportionately mixed up in him that anyone approaching him does not fail to
mark his detachment, though equally impressed by his extraordinary mastery of
worldly facts, his qualities of statesmanship and organisational drive. There
has been none in our times who seems so absolutely devoid of any desire to make
demands on anyone or anything in order to sustain even his minimum needs. He is
strikingly all-comprehending, and yet so approachable and simple. His
influence, to use a famous Western saint’s description of Godhead, is ‘like a
circle whose centre is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere.’ He
possesses a widespread compassion for all and yet secures to everyone
individually the intimacy and confidence in his unobtrusive sympathies.
Austerity and love have scarcely been so happily betrothed to each other, and
added to them is a rare memory for details and an administrative genius of a
high order.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yet
at a juncture in our country when spiritual resources were conspicuously
misapplied and betrayed a considerable want of one-pointed devotion to the
higher ends of man, the Acharyaswami came to the Peetam consecrated by the
illustrious Bhagavatpada, who had established the religion of fearlessness
four-square against all violent winds of atheism that blowed over the land
once. The Acharyaswami’s is a powerful vision and a widely embracing one, so
that it could not be allowed to add merely lustre to the office of a religious
head. The excellence of his subtle intellect, the rareness of his gifts, his
flair for languages, are universally known; but the breadth of his outlook, his
entire concentration on saving swerving mortals from their distractions, places
him outside the pale of normal <i>Matadhipatis. </i>He belongs to humanity even
more than he belongs to this school of philosophy or that. The Kamakotipeetam
Mutt cannot but adhere to hidebound traditions. It believes in certain forms of
undiluted orthodoxy and can spare, if at all, only conventional delinquents.
Hence its lack of a sense of realism and aloofness from modernism and also its
obscurity otherwise, even while some of its exponents had been personalities of
great spiritual grandeur.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is this tradition that has made the Acharyaswami to be perennially employed in <i>pujas
</i>and purificatory baths. Still the heritage of Adi Sankara is admittedly
gaining in him its original glory. It makes a profound appeal even to the
uninitiated. The quiet yet real austerity of the Acharyaswami is its chief
attraction, qualified only by his inordinate sense of renunciation. He plays no
mean part in the spiritual renascence we are experiencing. His name is ever
borne far and wide on wings of the faithful and the unfaithful alike, for both
seem to have a strong faith in him and his redeeming qualities. To one and all
his name is a magic <i>mantra. </i>It has a charm of its own that, for them, no
other contemporary name with the exception of the late Jagadguru of Sringeri,
possesses. It is like a shower of rose water on a hot summer noon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
we probe the mystery of his magnetism, we shall be only finding ourselves
dwelling upon the mystery of his indwelling spirit. He is a representative of
Advaitic philosophy, though Advaita itself is not a <i>mata </i>in the sense
other Indian philosophical persuasions are known to students. It has recognised
the existence of One supreme spirit pervading all creation and hence its non-recognition
of a second. Only when there is a second is there room for anything like fear
of it, and because of the fact that it recognises the One without a second, it
has generated in the human breast hope eternal of its high destiny, not to be
destroyed by anything on earth. It is by this grand conception that the
Acharyaswami’s catholicity can be easily explained, not to speak of his own <i>Samskaras
</i>and inner evolution which have endowed him with a magnificent humanity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

turn to his attributes which have endeared him to high and low as well, is to
live in an atmosphere rarefied by his grace. Long before he became famous he
had ascended the <i>gadi, </i>yet it took nearly two decades for him to come
into his own spiritual abode. When he was on his itineraries, he slowly
gathered round him maturer minds who began to scan in that youthful figure and
resplendent gaze a fund of spiritual power and guidance. The whole of his <i>Yatra
</i>(travel) was envisaged by him only in terms of his own sublimation through
witnessing every nook and corner, every temple and sacred water of his dear
Bharata-Varsha. Once when an intrepid interlocutor asked him ‘How do you assume
Jagadguruship? Isn’t it too patently absurd?’, his quick reply was, ‘Yes, the
misconception is not mine, for I have conceived of the entire universe to be my
teacher, my Guru.’ Therein lies his superiority over others. Mere
resourcefulness may be attributed to this reply of his, yet to the calmly
reflecting mind it means really more than a passing sally of wit. The sage of
Kamakoti peetam never looks down upon anyone or any creature. Even the animals
of the Mutt share the same hospitality at his hands as his human disciples. The
elephant, the camel, the cow, the bull, the calf, the dog, every little and big
creature forming part of his entourage receives in full measure his personal
attention and care even as every visitor to the Mutt and every devotee in his </span><span

discipline is something unusual, and not a wink can intrude upon his vigils. If
he has an inborn taste for good music and a beautiful talent to give shape
through his own voice to some of the musical ideas within, he will not forget
the stern discipline that his <i>ashrama </i>should exert over him. Once on an
evening at <i>pradosha </i>he recited to a rapt audience a sloka from the
‘Soundarya Lahari’. He paraphrased every line of the verse with his soft,
tenderly-intoned, spoken Tamil. He described the occasion when Goddess
Saraswati, holding the Veena (Vipanchi) in her hands and tuning it began to
sing, when all of a sudden she felt disturbed on hearing Goddess Parvati’s
words of encouragement to her music, sounding sweeter to her ears and even
causing strangely a feeling of ill-attunement in her instrument which forced
her to hasten to push it in its cover and relegate it to a corner. The Swami
for a moment indulged in faultless Sindhu Bhairavi raga, but only a moment, for
with lightning effect came the check on himself and he made his music yield
place to the words of the verse and their exposition. Indeed his control proved
the stronger for his passion for music.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Acharyaswami strikes one as working day in, day out, for the safe voyaging of
the world in spiritual matters. Forgetful of his need for relaxation, sounding
the depths of his soul in some totally far-off dusty village near a pond or
pool of fresh water, he can go on performing his worship of Chandramoulisvarar
with whatever offerings of fruit and flower the poor peasantry of near-by
places can gather for him. The routine is never changing. It is the routine
through which he passes and repasses in order to reach his goal of serenity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

comes not through insouciance or complacency or through administration of
potions of superstitious ritualism. It comes only through an enlargement of the
mind, a sovereign outlook of optimism, a kindly gaze at seething life around
and a splendid faith in practical Advaita. All these and more the head of the
Kanchi Kamakotipeetam has. In his spacious presence there is no room for
smallnesses and intolerances. All is dissolved because no one has need for ego.
All is understood, because all is bathed in the sunshine of his smile. He
penetrates the heart of every adult and child with a consuming power, but he
penetrates it with a balmy touch, never with a pricking motive. He clears the
mind of the pedant and the pandit of the hanging cobwebs of confusion and
undigested learning. He can, if he wants, easily enter an argument of a highly
metaphysical nature, only in order to prove how very essential <i>sastras </i>are
for a mind to get disciplined in the search of Truth. But in the process, the
person dealt with never shudders at the revelation, hardly feels touchy or<i> </i>discomfited–only
the experience is salubrious enough to make him throw off his <i>erstwhile </i>drowsiness
and feel awakened from a mental torpor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>He is a staunch student of archaeology, and
epigraphy, one of the few researchers–if the term may be applied in its best
sense to him,–with no desire for credit of having discovered some of the most
useful information in reconstructing the history of the Kamakoti Mutt. His
speeches and talks, collected so far in print, are better appreciated by
professors of history and scholars of<i> </i>antiquity for their fund of
original material and their flood of light on topics baffling normal plodders
in the field. In his religious discourses there is neither authoritarianism nor
polemics.</p>

leaves narrow points of difference in the various schools of philosophy and
wings the azure heavens of a vast perception of the true spirit. The whole
series of his sermons may be called <i>Message of Hinduism. </i>They are
embedded with gems of thought and naturalness of observation. He speaks in
simple Samskrita and Tamil, sentences often of not more than half a dozen
words, not snappy, but refreshingly linking the developing sequence of a
thought into a whole, profound thesis. His philosophy is only love. There are
no portals Of the enlightened and the learned to that sanctorum, but all are of
it, who care for sincerity and sacrifice, who hear there the voice of God and
determine to follow it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

devotees belong to all kinds of philosophical persuasions; but most of all his
heart envelops those exiles from the old order, who have regenerated themselves
as followers of a liberal Hinduism. For these, as for all those who make heavy
sacrifices for keeping their integrity unsullied, he has not merely good
feeling but wholesome regard. In his behaviour the impression he creates is of
a superior type of generosity and charity. His mind laves in no stagnant pool,
but shears its way through a hybridized world, and the tone of his conversation
lifts the mediocre too from his ennui and blesses him with an unusual
satisfaction that he has not lived in vain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

he is a rare specimen of Sanyasa, unaffected in his intellectual approach to
problems and uncanny divination of the causes of our social upheavals. He is
ready to forgive and forget any serious blemish in character with an air of
utter unsophistication. If a boy of ten reading in a school, pretends to have filled
pages and pages with the holy script of <i>Sri Rama Jayam </i>and makes the
Acharyaswami believe him to be the scribe, while later he himself confesses to
his elder brother alone having been the scribe, there is no evident twitch or
fierceness of look in the face of the Jagadguru, but only a smile as he
remarks, ‘So your brother has done this and feels shy to present it himself to
me lest his classmates in the college should rail at him. Go and tell him not
to feel any shame. Anyhow, you can take a gold coin for it with my blessings.’
The crowd round about watching the incident is really amazed first at the
little urchin’s audacity to play tricks with the Swami and equally amazed at
the great one’s intuitive divination of the cause of the boy’s elder brother’s folly,
and much more amazed at the final words of comfort administered by the High
Priest of Advaita to the young culprit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

way, which, according to him, is the only way. His genuine interest is in uplifting
the masses from the morass of penury and the still worse penury of the soul.

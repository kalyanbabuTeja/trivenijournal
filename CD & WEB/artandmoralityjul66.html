style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Indian
thinkers have always paid particular attention to the ethical aspect of
aesthetics and the relation of art to morality. The greatness of a country or a
nation is not to be measured merely by its material achievements. It is really
a moral and spiritual quality to be appreciated through a study of the national
literature, arts, philosophy and religion. These represent the nation’s most
developed consciousness and most delicate sensibility. The art of a country
derives its inspiration from the people’s life and in turn it quickens and
enriches that life. Historically Indian art appears about the third millennium
B. C. spreading over a vast sub-continent and across several centuries. It has
different aspects to it: Music, Drama, Sculpture, Painting and Literature. Yet
if we try to see it steadily and see it whole, as Mathew Arnold would want us
to view life, it possesses not only an unbroken continuity but also a certain
unity in its diverse manifestations. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
art of a people is inspired by certain fundamental motifs. It springs from
certain basic ideals. Thus the Egyptians in their Pyramids and Sphinxes tried
to reach out to the mysterious and </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the unknown. Ancient
Greece was moved by a naturalism that </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>drew its inspiration
from life. The Greek gods and goddesses were idealized men and women, a
crystallized perfection of what they aspired to be. Renaissance Art with all
its religious themes was an inspiration of the spirit, other-worldly and
Godward. All these in a sense represent the race-memory, the race-experience
and the race-consciousness. The artist gives a concrete expression to the
ideals that move him and the people around him. The designs, the patterns, the
symbols, the movements, are the visible forms of the inner urge that demands
refined representation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
then are the Ideals of Indian Art? In a word Indian Art is idealistic, seeking
and interpreting the mysteries of natural phenomena. It is not content with
copying external features. It does not hesitate to adopt unusual forms to
express transcendental ideas. It goes far beyond imitation of nature. In the
West, to use Alexander Pope’s revealing expression, “Art is only nature to
advantage dressed.” It keeps close to nature. But Indian art believes that all
that is visible is not necessarily real and tries to penetrate the outer
surface and reach the true inner reality of things. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
realize the Infinite, to grasp the reality which is behind all natural
phenomena, to read the meaning of what is transitory and elusive has been the
aim of the Indian artist through the centuries. Whether he worked in stone, in
colour, in musical sounds, or literary symbols he sought always a glimpse of
reality, of the essential unity of all existence. To him the universe was
merely a manifestation of the Divine Essence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Reality
and Unity are the two motifs of Indian art that give it its distinctive note of
idealism, mysticism, symbolism and transcendentalism. Indian art is a search
for reality and the ultimate unity of existence. These motifs are worked into
the ‘Collective consciousness’ and issue in the nation’s sculpture, music,
painting, dance and poetry. Art may even be described as the unique expression
of a historic process. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
soil out of which Indian art springs and flourishes is largely religious. It is
an endeavour to seek God through a process of self-culture and
self-realisation. The Buddha raised the question, what is the solution for the
ills that flesh is heir to. Life is futile, suffering is inevitable. We have to
break through the bonds of <i>Karma </i>and emerge into <i>Nirvana, </i>a state
of ceasing to be through renunciation, contemplation, service and charity to
all living beings, the goal can be reached. The heroic figure of the master who
himself suffered, so as to know the nature of suffering, and to discover a way
out of it, inspired Buddhist art, one of the glories of Indian culture. The
Buddha, in the form of a Yogi, meditating under the Bodhi Tree, seeking to be
in tune with the Infinite, became a great symbol of Indian art in its various
manifestations. The Buddha sits calm, peaceful, unruffled, freed from all
worldly passions and desires, raised above all earthly strife and vexation,
with eyes that look but within, in perfect union with the Universal Soul.
Another familiar theme of the Indian artists is that of creation, to exemplify
which they conceived the image of the Dancing Siva,–who executes the dance of
creation sending waves of life through inert matter, waves of awakening sound
and life-giving breath. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Indian conception of beauty differs from that which inspired the Apollo
Belvedere, Venus de Milo, the Winged Victory, the Madonnas of Botticelli and
Raphael, the master-pieces of Michael Angelo and Rembrandt. These are beautiful
things, no doubt, pleasing to the eye by the rhythm of line, colour, form,
perspective and proportion. Nevertheless, it is a beauty of earthly things,
‘beauty clipped’ as E. B. Havel puts it. Indian art, on the contrary, takes
wings, as it were, and flies into the Empyrean, into the regions of sublime
thought and realms of spirituality. Indian art is obviously attempting, to
quote Havel again, ‘to bring down to earth something of the beauty of things
above.’ <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
essence of Art is <i>Rasa </i>which may be translated as Relish or Flavour. A
work of art is <i>Rasavat, </i>embodying beauty, joy and a feeling of
elevation, mystic experience and spiritual satisfaction. Religion and art come
close together. They deal with the same kind of activity or experience–an
intuition of reality, an intimation of the identity of the individual with the
Universe. The spirit of man breaks through the crust of the material
environment, and mortal existence. <i>Rasa </i>is Truth. <i>Rasa </i>is
Reality. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
may be asked whether ‘reality’ exists as an absolute entity apart form the
artist, and as something inherent in the divine order of things. The answer is
that it is not personal to him and that he can only catch a glimpse and put it
in concrete form for the edification of himself and others. The artist is
privileged to reveal God to us, to reveal the life within the life, the
Noumenon within the phenomenon, the soul that lives encased in matter for the
time being. The Indian artist does not strive after merely physical or earthly
beauty. He hitches his waggon to a star. He is after spiritual excellence. He
wants to portray, whatever may be his medium, the inner, informing, inspiring,
impulse. He calls to his aid, <i>Yoga, </i>an intense concentration on the
object to be realized, and an identification with it. Thus Valmiki wrote the
famous epic of the Ramayana. By means of concentration, he relived in his
imagination the story of Sri Rama, caught the spirit of it, and enshrined it in
imperishable verse. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Indian
aestheties is known by the name of <i>Alankara Sastra; </i>and since this
branch of the study of aesthetics takes up poetics as its main subject, I am
dealing somewhat in detail with the theme of beauty in poetry. The subject
matter of <i>Alankara Sastra </i>is patterned closely after the subject matter
of the Science of Reality <i>(Brahmavidya). </i>Indian artistic studies
institute a quest after the ‘Soul of the Arts.’ The term <i>Kavyam </i>denotes
a poetic composition. In its higher significance it means the soul of the Arts.
Take for example the statement of Vamana that ‘style is the soul of poetry’. (<i>Riti
ratma Kavyasya: Kavyalankara sutravritti). </i>Style <i>(Riti) </i>may be
briefly defined thus: In the sphere of the poetic work, the lightness <i>(lalitya)
</i>of the words produced by their intermingling with one another, by
conjunctions <i>(Samasa), </i>by the alternation of long and short <i>(Dirgha </i>and
<i>Hrasva) </i>- the commingling of these diverse elements, is called <i>riti. </i>It
is this which is called the <i>Atma </i>or soul of a work of poetry. In other
words a composition not having this commingling of words and ideas is not a
poetic work. Anandavardhana declared that the soul of poetry is suggestion <i>(Dhvani).
</i>Word <i>(Sabda), </i>meaning <i>(Artha), </i>excellence <i>(Guna) </i>decoration
or embellishment <i>(Alankara), </i>style<i> (Riti), </i>absence of defect–all
these increase the beauty of a poetic composition. The implied poetic meaning
is the heart of the poetic composition. Jagannatha opines that as the conveyor
of a beautiful meaning, the word is the soul of a poetic composition. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>According
to the Indian view, the purpose of Art is to teach delightfully and to lead one
to supreme bliss. Therefore the aim of aesthetics is considered to be the same
as the aim of the <i>Vedas.</i></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
ease with which even the uninitiated in the <i>Vedas </i>can achieve the four <i>purusharthas
</i>(or objects of man’s life) <i>Dharma, Artha, Kama </i>and <i>Moksha. </i>(merit,
wealth, enjoyment and liberation) by a knowledge, and appreciation of poetry is
aptly and truly brought out by Visvanatha in his <i>Sahityadarpana. </i>‘As the
four kinds or fruit (vis. merit, wealth, enjoyment and liberation) can be
attained in a delightful manner through poetry even by ordinary men, the shape
of that poetry will now be unfolded.’ Visvanatha delights to portray the glory
of words. He quotes from Patanjali’s <i>Mahabhashya </i>which says: He who
knows the grammatical use of a word, having understood its full meaning, is
capable of realizing his desires in the heavens. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The variety and
richness of aesthetic experience is so vast that it is capable of strengthening
the spirit of man, of reaffirming his faith in himself. Kalidasa enumerated
four important aims of art: (a) Art causes delight to the Gods, and the sages
have considered drama to be an attractive offering to them. (b) Art deals with
the conduct of man, displays the joys and sorrows of life, which are engendered
chiefly by the three <i>Gunas–Sattva, Rajas </i>and <i>Tamas</i>–or the
qualities of goodness, restlessness and inertia. By displaying the interaction
of these forces a great drama could be created. (c) Art brings home to the
devotee many types of transcendental pleasure because it displays many <i>Rasas.
</i>(d) Finally, art is the giver of universal delight. There is nothing else
which can delight all types of people–young and old, the joyful, the
grief-stricken, the sick and ailing, the hale and hearty–as art does. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
must remember that the purpose of art is to elevate, to uplift. This
exaltation, however short and temporary it may be, is but the means to induce
in us some moment of delight, which will be an encouragement to discover more
deeply what real and lasting pleasure is. Towards that end the appreciation of
art is a strong incentive. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
realization of delight from the arts is supposed to be a preliminary stage to
the realization of the delight of <i>Brahman </i>or the Supreme Being. The
relationship of these two kinds of delight is like that of the relationship
between the image and its reflection. “In teaching something new to young
pupils, it is necessary to make learning attractive to them; one useful device
would be to start with something known to them, which, though fictitious, is as
near as possible to the truth, and then from there to lead them to truth.”
Similarly <i>Kavyananda </i>is something more easily appreciated and realized
than <i>Brahmananda</i>; through it we can advance to the realization of <i>Brahman,
</i>and thus proceed from the known to the unknown. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman"'>and <i>Brahmananda </i>have this in common–they are both
transcendental in nature. They are both unalloyed bliss. Their main difference
is, that in <i>Kavyananda, </i>the realization of bliss is temporary, lasting
only until the passing away of the major causes of artistic delight, whereas in
<i>Brahmananda, </i>the bliss is permanent. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

a close resemblance is suggested between the creative artist and the creator of
the universe. Both are artists who create something fresh, interesting, varied
and pulsating with life. As the <i>Kavyaprakasa </i>puts it: “The creation of
the poet is un-checked; it gives unalloyed joy, is not bound by anything, and
is replete with the entire emotional gamut by the employment of the </span><span

because of the sentiment it portrays.” Jagannatha Pandita explicitly says that a

is contemplated by Abhinavagupta in his opening verse of the <i>Lochana </i>where
he says: “All hail to literary principles of the poet-critic combination, a

is illustrated by the imaginative powers of the firs Indian poet Valmiki. The
poet saw one of a pair of herons being shot down by a hunter. Valmiki saw the
surviving herons piteously. This was his <i>perceptional experience. </i>Later,
he had the experience transferred to his imagination. This in its turn stirred
up within him his instinct of pathos; and in such a moment of intense feeling,
he burst out into spontaneous verse. Later he used this poetic urge to write <i>Ramayana

the delineation of sentiment depends mainly upon three things–subject, figures
and style. Imagination helps a poet in the creation of subject matter. Thus <i>Malati-Madhavam

speech Anandavardhana shows that a poet of imagination need not struggle for
suitable figures of speech at all, but that they come to him in a flood, in his
imaginative mood. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

has already been pointed out that Jagannatha defines imagination as the ability
to use word and sense to make up a composition. Now it is clear from
Anandavardhana that a great poet uses words which are suggestive and hence the
production of a composition of great delectation. He makes this point very
clear in one of his famous pronouncements. “The expressions of great poets
streaming with delightful content reveal their extraordinary imagination which
is both bright and transcendental.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

all comes to this, that the function of a poet is not to represent merely
things as they are in the world. This would become more <i>Lohadharmi </i>or
realism. But when a poet by means of his imaginative powers creates a new
world, he makes his writings more interesting. This would be turning the world
of realism into that of idealism; and this transformation is done by poetic
imagination. Such transformation is the exclusive privilege of the poet.
Anandavardhana in this connection draws our attention to a prevailing view that
“in the unlimited world of poesy the poet alone is the creator, and the world
revolves in the manner he desireth.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>shines only when it is touched by
propriety. But Anandavardhana shows that, when a poet displays great
imagination, then, even if he does not observe propriety, the composition
shines at its best. He cites here the instance of <i>Kumarasambhaua </i>of
Kalidasa. The poet depicts here the <i>Sambhoga Sringara, </i>the love scenes
of God and Goddess–a highly improper thing to do. The imagination displayed by
Kalidasa in the <i>Kumarasambhava </i>has made the text otherwise
objectionable, one of relish. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

all moods. This sentiment is said to reach the pinnacle of aesthetic
experience. In the epics like the <i>Bhagavata </i>or in compositions like the <i>Dravida

a mood greater even than that of <i>Sringara. </i>Krishna is called by his
devotee, ‘the blazing blue sapphire.’ The mere thought of Krishna’s blue body

Samskrit language consists of 51 <i>bijaksharas </i>(seed letters). <i>Bija </i>means
seed. And the infinitesimal seed is capable of producing a tree. Thus <i>bija </i>by
itself properly intoned or by a combination with other <i>bijas </i>is capable
of giving results undreamt of before. According to Hindu occult<i> </i>science <i>Dhvani
</i>or <i>nada </i>produced by the letters is an outer manifestation of the
Supreme Being. By a judicious use and by proper understanding of the results
produced by <i>bijas </i>a glimpse of the all-highest truth is possible. Truth
and beauty are intertwined and intermixed, and so are word and meaning. The
understanding of the one leads to the other. Hence the importance attached to <i>dhvani

is the objective of all Indian art. Take the example of iconography. All those
who are devout or interested in art know that in all the temples of India the
vast majority of images relate to the depiction of facets of the Godhead and
His deeds. It is one of the principal aims of Indian sculpture. In painting it
is the same. Ravi Varma, the celebrated painter, felt that painting was the
best when it depicted God and His deeds. In the field of Indian music,
Thyagaraja, Dikshitar and Purandaradasa–all sang of God and His glories and His
mighty deeds. The best of our temples again reflect the glory of God. Dance and
drama besides are chiefly to please the gods. So too the best of literary
classics deal with <i>Dharma. </i>The celebrated drama of <i>Prabodhachandrodaya
</i>deals with Vedantic doctrines. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

whole principle of Indian aesthetics can be summed up in<b> </b>one sentence:
The worship of beauty is primarily of interest as a worship of God, because
beauty is nothing but God; only secondarily is beauty an attribute of the
things of the world. As the Gita says: “Whatever is vast, good, auspicious,
mighty understand thou that it exists as a spark of my splendour.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

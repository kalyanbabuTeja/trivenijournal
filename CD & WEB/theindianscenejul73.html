font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
Delhi agreement between India and Pakistan which concluded on August 28 after a
great deal of bargaining is the one outstanding event in the quarter July-September.
It settled two of the issues which arose out of the war of 1971 leaving two
other issues for settlement after negotiations with Bangladesh. The issues settled
were the repatriation of the 90,000 Pakistani prisoners of war in the custody
of India and of the Bengali civilians interned in Pakistan. The issues left for
subsequent negotiations are the exact number of non-Bengalis in Bangladesh to
be repatriated to Pakistan and the trial of 195 Pakistani officers accused by
Bangladesh of having committed war crimes of a highly serious character. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
Pakistani prisoners of war should have been freed in the normal course
immediately after the war. India, however, did not do so mainly because she
wanted to use them as hostages for obtaining Pakistan’s recognition of
Bangladesh. At the time of Simla agreement in 1972 Bhutto undertook to
recognise Bangladesh at an early date. But he put it off, perhaps, owing to
certain domestic difficulties with which he was faced. He did not also show any
great keenness to have the prisoners of war restored to freedom. India therefore
had to revise its views on using them as a bargaining counter to get
recognition for Bangladesh. She had to incur a huge expenditure in maintaining
them, an expenditure which Bangladesh was not willing to share. Bhutto also
took to carrying on an anti-Indian campaign in the international world on this
issue. It was then that India persuaded Bangladesh to agree to the repatriation
of the prisoners of war, irrespective of her being recognised by Bhutto. In the
agreement concluded as a result of this, the two countries expressed their
willingness to repatriate on humanitarian grounds the prisoners of war except
those to be tried for war crimes, provided that Pakistan agreed to send back to
Bangladesh the Bengali civilians interned by her and take back the non-Bengalis
in Bangladesh who opted for Pakistani citizenship. It was expected <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>that humanitarian </span>grounds would make
an effective appeal to Bhutto. But he took several months to give due
consideration to the proposals put forward <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>by <o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Finally
he agreed to hold discussions on the proposals. They were first discussed at
Islamabad and later in Delhi. The Delhi agreement was the outcome of these
discussions. At one time it appeared that they would end in a stalemate as
Bhutto was not prepared to give up his stand on the issue of trials for war
crimes and the exact number of non-Bengalis in Bangladesh <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>to </span>be repatriated. Wiser counsels
prevailed in the end. It was agreed to repatriate all the prisoners of war and
the Bengali civilians in Pakistan. There was further agreement that about
50,000 out of a total of nearly 3,00,000 non-Bengalis in Bangladesh should be
immediately repatriated and the question of the trial of war criminals and the
additional number of non-Bengalis <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>to </span>be
repatriated <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>to </span>be settled later
through negotiations in which Bangladesh should participate along with India
and Pakistan. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>India
is glad that it is able to get rid of the prisoners of war. As Bangladesh is
not prepared to participate in a tri-partite conference until her sovereign
equality is recognised by Pakistan, the expectation now is that Bhutto would
grant recognition at an early date. This is however uncertain. He can afford to
wait indefinitely for the settlement of these two questions. He hopes that,
just as on the issue of repatriation of prisoners of war India and Bangladesh
revised their earlier stands, they would do the same in respect of these two
questions also. It looks as if his hopes will be fulfilled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
Delhi agreement has not brought about the normalisation of relations between
India and Pakistan. Bhutto continues to harp on the Kashmir issue. This is the
major bone of contention between the two countries. Unless he gives up his
demand that there should be a plebiscite to settle the position of Kashmir, there
is no chance of any kind of compromise between him and India. Another point on
which he has been laying emphasis these months is that there should be military
parity between India and Pakistan and he has been trying to negotiate with the
United States and China and <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>to </span>some
extent even with Soviet Russia to secure this objective. But he is not likely to
succeed as all these powers feel <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>that
it is unrealistic for Pakistan with a population of only forty millions to </span>try
<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>to </span>secure parity with India
with her population of five hundred and fifty millions and with her immensely
superior material resources. India and Bangladesh may have therefore to <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>reconcile </span>themselves to <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>this </span>atmosphere of tensions without
which Pakistan <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>is </span>not able to live.

Even those who by temperament are most optimistic feel that the situation <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>is </span>daily worsening instead of showing
signs of improvement. Its outward <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>symbols
</span>are the phenomenal rise in prices <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>especially

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This
raises a fundamental question. How was it that these leaders and agitators have
been able <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>to </span>carry out the
process of de-hoarding while officials armed with legitimate authority were unable
to find out who the hoarders were and take hold of the grain and other
essentials they hoarded? The answer to this question lies in the large amount
of corruption which has overtaken all ranks of those who are endowed with
legitimate authority. They do not care for the public good. They are in league
with hoarders and blacktnarketeers because this enables them to grow rich. This
is the case with not only the members of the civil services of all grades–from
top to bottom–but also of ministers and the large number of politicians who
constitute the ruling elite. In several states where food riots took place and
political parties like the CPI, CPM and even the Congress (O) and pressure
groups like Shiva Sena of Bombay played an active role in the de-hoarding
process the vigilance organisations of Government became subsequently active
and newspapers have reported that they seized stocks surreptitiously kept by
hoarders and made them available for distribution to consumers through fair
price shops. This shows that it is not beyond the capacity of governments to
deal with the phenomenon of rising prices and come to the rescue of consumers
to some extent at least. It may not be easy to deal with the more fundamental
issues like economic stagnation and unemployment but a similar difficulty does
not exist in preventing the hoarding of stocks and making them available to
consumers. Men in authority have miserably failed in discharging their
responsibilities as public servants. This is not due so much to their being incompetent
as to their being dishonest. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Prime Minister has been telling us that corruption is not peculiar to our country
and it is found throughout the world. She has also been telling us that it is
an old phenomenon in our public life, the only difference being that more
publicity is given to it now than in the past. All this may be true, but this
does not afford consolation to the millions of people in the country who have
to face untold suffering due to the rise in prices. She has to take drastic action
against erring politicians however high-placed they may be and against public
servants who misuse power to promote their own ends and care little for the
interest of the public at large. Otherwise the danger is that the country will
drift into anarchy and chaos and the rule of the jungle–the rule that might is
right–will prevail.<i> <o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

is an intimate connection between the growing strength of agitators and the
increase in the number of unemployed. It is the unemployed that automatically swell
the ranks of agitatoras. Not being able to earn their living by honest work for
no fault of their own, they are compelled to join the ranks of agitators and
get something paid in return. Let us not forget that among those who
participate in processions, and in de-hoarding campaigns and in all other
agitations, there are large numbers of paid professional agitators. <span

resort to blackmail and sabotage by Government employees of all ranks to compel

style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>incidents </span>in the quarter<span

the locomen’s strike in Railways which led to the paralysis of passenger and
goods traffic for a number of days. Apart from the inconvenience which it
caused to passengers and the blow which it struck against several industries
which depended upon the supply of coal and other essentials for their smooth
running, it interfered with the supply of food grains to drought affected areas
and inflicted a loss of more than eighty crores of rupees on Railways. The <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>main </span>demand of the locomen was that
their hours of daily work should be reduced from fourteen to eight. This was
based on the recommendation of a committee appointed by Government sometime
earlier. Government should have taken action on it but it preferred to keep
quiet as it always does until the situation becomes impossible. Ultimately it
yielded to the demand of the locomen not so much because it was convinced of
the rationality behind the demand but because it had no force to carryon the
fight with the locomen. It was more or less in the position of a belligerent
country which is subject to bombing and other kinds of destruction by the enemy
forces and which ultimately surrenders because it is unable to resist those
forces. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was also the strike of the interns and the doctors employed in the municipal

under suffering. They fought to the bitter end until the authorities agreed to
give a favourable consideration to their demands. It speaks ill of the
authorities that they did not create all these years a tribunal through which
disputes of this character could be settled through negotiation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

serious perhaps than these was the sabotage resorted to by power engineers in

Engineers, who was an employee of the Punjab Government, should be withdrawn, a
demand which no Government can concede. There were the courts of law to decide
in the usual course whether the charges were true or false but the power
engineers wanted to take the law into their own hands and compel the Government
to yield to them by plunging the city of Delhi in darkness and by obstructing
power supply to numerous industrial and other concerns. Another of their
demands was that power engineers should be given a place of parity with the
members of the Indian Administrative Service. This is an issue on which there
is room for difference of opinion. It is an issue as to whether a department<span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>–</span>even though it is technical in
character<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>–</span>should be headed by a
generalist like a member of I.A.S. or by a specialist. Academicians as well as
men involved in practical affairs have discussed this issue and most persons are
of the view that a generalist should be preferred to a specialist. Power engineers
should not have resorted to a strike or sabotage, occupying as they do highly
responsible positions to get such a controversial issue settled at the point of
the sword as it were and by holding the whole community to ransom. We have to
aim not only at right ends but also use the right means to achieve them. The
use of sabotage and blackmail for achieving a controversial objective has no
justification. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

this is least realised by Government employees. They happen to occupy <span

style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>they </span>can bring to a standstill all
administration. They are disposed to take undue advantage of this strategic
position which they hold unmindful of the loss they inflict on the community as
a <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>whole. H</span>ow <span

thing for workers in a factory producing non-essential goods to strike but
those in charge of public administration and running essential services should
think twice, thrice and even four times before <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:

style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>in </span>dealing with them. It must learn
to be a little hard and devise a suitable machinery to settle issues like these
and keep ready a band of trained people to take the place of those on strike. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Let
us remember in this connection that in <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>the
</span>post-independence period there has been a phenomenal growth in the
number of Government employees and in the emoluments <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>they </span>receive. Successive pay commissions have recommended such
increase <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>in </span>the matter of
emoluments. There has, however, been no corresponding increase in the
efficiency, in quickness of disposal of papers and files or in integrity. In
some states like Kerala as much as 96 per cent of the revenues raised by taxing
the common man <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>is </span>spent on the
salaries of Government personnel and there is very little that is available for
development. And yet the employees make all sorts of demands and want to
enforce them <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>by </span>holding the
whole community which bears the burden of expenditure on their salaries to
ransom. There <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>is </span>none to
sympathize with the tax-payer, with the consumer and with unorganised labour.
It is the organised labour–and Government employees <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>belong </span>to <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>this selecti</span>on–that
is in a position to exploit the country at large. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

other feature of the Indian scene <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>which
</span>should cause concern to all the responsible sections of society is the
growing involvement of students in political activities of an extremely
destructive character. During the quarter under review they diverted <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>their attention </span>to the de-hoarding campaign
and in some states displayed greater activity than even the political parties.
They also broke into rioting and came <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>into
</span>clash with the police in <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Bangalore,
Mandya </span>and several other localities of the Mysore State–all <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>this </span>because of the death of a
student while in police custody in Hasan. They resorted to large-scale
stone-throwing against buses, cars and other vehicles and to arson which has now
become an integral part of student violence. Much of this happened even after
the Government assured them that they would undertake a judicial enquiry into the
death of the student at Hasan. Finally the authorities ordered the closure of
the Bangalore University and its constituent colleges. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This
is becoming a recurring phenomenon in many parts of the country. The cause for
concern lies in the wider and long term implications of this phenomenon. The
implication consists in what will happen to the students as individual human beings
and to society of which they constitute an important section if they refuse as
they are now doing to play the role which for ages they have been expected to
play. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

an educational philosopher puts it, man is only physiologically human at birth.
In everything else he is like any other animal. It is through education
informally received during infancy from his parents, the other members in the
family and his immediate neighbourhood that he becomes really human and
cultivates the simple virtues of gentleness, kindliness, respect and reverence,
the virtues which enable him to behave like a human being towards other human
beings. This process is continued and systematised through formal education in
schools and colleges when students pass through them. If as students young men
and women refuse to get educated by neglecting their studies and engaging
themselves in all sorts of non-academic pursuits, which at that stage in their
lives are of no relevance to them, their progress towards humanization is arrested
and the brute in man gets strengthened. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

societies for thousands of years have made arrangements for the education of
the youth as this is necessary to maintain the continuity of the life of
society–a life which is based on a set of inherited beliefs, conventions, forms
of worship, and modes of behaviour in the economic, political and other fields
of public life. Every generation has to be formally educated in all this. This
is why in our country our ancestors recognised the stage of Brahmacharya–the
stage of studenthood–as an essential stage in a man’s life and as an essential
preliminary to the efficient discharge of his duties as a householder and
citizen in the next stage of his life. No improvement in social life is
possible unless its foundations are first preserved and the training which
students get is intended to preserve these foundations. There may be many evils
and wrongs in society and it may be quite necessary to remove them by radical
methods. It is education, however, that enables men and women to know what
these evils and wrongs are and what methods should be adopted to eradicate
them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

refusal of young men and women to play their role as students thus amounts to
their deliberately undermining the foundations of society and ushering in a
period of chaos and anarchy. These are the deeper implications of student
involvement in political activities of an agitational character and their
indulgence in violence. This is why it has become a cause of concern. Let us
hope that the situation will improve and students concentrate their attention
on things of significance to them and to the larger society to which they
belong. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Dutavakya, Dutaghatotkacha, Karnabhara, </i>and the <i>Urubhanga. </i>The <i>Pancharatra
</i>must be treated separately, since it is the only Three-Act play of Bhasa
and also since it is unique in dispensing with the fratricidal war. The play
ends on a note of harmony which is absent in the Epic or elsewhere. The other
five are beautiful One-Act plays, easily staged and comparable to the modern

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
One-Act plays suggest that Bhasa definitely knows about the devastating
Kuru-Pandava War. In the <i>Pancharatra </i>he exhibits his own personal bent
of mind, depicting Duryodhana as a peace-loving monarch imposed upon by his
evil geniuses Karna, Dussasana, and more particularly his cunning and scheming
uncle, Sakuni. Certain basic ideas of Bhasa find their first expression herein,
and without a proper realisation of these fundamental ideas we cannot study the
One-Act dramas in their proper perspective. The 37th verse in Act I makes it
clear that Duryodhana is conceived by Bhasa as the eldest among the hundred and
five brothers. In this respect he definitely differs from the Epic, according
to which Yudhishthira is the eldest and Bhima and Duryodhana are both born on
the same day. The advantage that accrues to Bhasa from this supposition is
obvious: from the <i>Dharma-sastra </i>standpoint Duryodhana <i>alone </i>must
inherit the entire paternal kingdom, for, according to the laws of inheritance
in almost all ancient countries like India, Rome and Greece, the eldest alone
succeeds to the entire estate by the law of Primogeniture, referred to as <i>jyaishthyam
</i>in Ancient India. According to this viewpoint, Duryodhana, the senior most
member of the senior family, could easily be regarded as the <i>pater familias </i>or
the head of the family and there was nothing wrong or improper if the younger
cousins, the Pandavas of the junior branch of Pandu, were denied their share of
the patrimony; of course, the lawgivers like Manu prescribed that the younger
members should depend upon him entirely for their maintenance (Manu, IX. 105).
It was obviously not Duryodhana’s fault if the Pandavas chose to stay away. In
the, <i>Dutavakya, </i>verse 21, Bhasa‘s Duryodhana goes a step further and
questions even the legitimacy of the birth of these cousins of his. He says:
“My uncle offended against some sage who denied him sexual enjoyment by a curse:
these therefore are not my cousins, but they are <i>paratmajas </i>or 8ons of
others (of the respective gods who begot them) and as such they can never claim
any share in my ancestral property!” Even with such a rough exterior, Bhasa’s
Duryodhana, in the <i>Pancharatra </i>at least, is a loving father whose
affection is spontaneous and sincere even towards Abhimanyu in III. 4. His
sentiment is praiseworthy: “The elders may quarrel, but this is no fault of the
youngsters. Abhimanyu is now my son first, and shame on us that we allowed him
to be captured by our enemies!” As though to suggest that Duryodhana was a
virtuous person imposed upon by his evil advisers, we find that in the <i>Urubhanga
</i>after the death of all of them, Duryodhana definitely requests Balarama not
exhibit his wrath towards the Pandavas who might have wronged his favourite
disciple. When Balarama points out to him that he has been defeated in an
unfair fight by Bhima who violated the rules of fair warfare by striking him
below the belt, Duryodhana replies in verse 35 that his defeat and impending
death was due, if at all, to his being disliked by that favourite of the world,
Sri Krishna. Even when the evil advisers are living, in his <i>Pancharatra, </i>Bhasa
imagines a context after verse 42 in Act I where, when Drona asks for the
division of the ancestral property as his <i>dakshina, </i>Duryodhana actually
pleads with his uncle, “Let me give them their share.” According to Bhasa’s
standpoint in the <i>Urubhanga, </i>Duryodhana is not guilty of even conniving
at the wholesale murder, when they are asleep, of the innocent children of the
Pandavas. Asvathaman enters, as in the Epic, to get Duryodhana’s approval for
this nefarious action of his but here according to Bhasa, Duryodhana definitely
refuses to associate his name in any way with this most unfair wholesale
murder. He even pleads (in verse 61) with him to give up this idea and
Asvathaman wonders whether Bhima had deprived Duryodhana of his self-respect
when he broke his thighs. Following Bhasa’s lead, Bhatta Narayana makes
Dhritarashtra responsible for this wholesale murder. This partiality for
Duryodhana (which makes both Balarama and Asvathaman declare that Duryodhana
was deceived by Bhima) indicates an early date for Bhasa, before the final
redaction of the <i>Mahabharata </i>which, according to all critical
investigators like Hopkins or Winternitz, was long prior to the Christian era
and in which the sympathies of the editors were pro-Pandava or pro-Krishna.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now
coming to the individual dramas, we can easily see that the basic idea of the <i>Yajna
</i>that Duryodhana performs to win over the affections of Drona is altogether
absent from the Epic; even the final note of <i>saubhratram </i>or
brotherliness on which the drama ends (which also seems to be Bhasa’s message
to a war-ridden world) is a novel one. In between these two pleasing
deviations, the entire story obviously proceeds on novel lines, refreshing and
enlivening us at every turn. To turn to but a few examples, the <i>gograhana </i>or
the cattle-lifting, which is largely purposeless in the Epic, becomes invested
with a definite purpose herein, since it has been undertaken by Duryodhana to
punish King Virata who had dared to absent himself from the sacrifice performed
by the imperial sovereign (where attendance by every tributary king was compulsory).
Abhimanyu attends this sacrifice as a representative of Sri Krishna, and so he
accompanies the Kauravas and fights against both Bhima and Arjuna, without
knowing their identity. In the end he is captured by Bhima; and entertaining is
the account by Bhasa of the fight and subsequent capture of Abhimanyu, his
strange behaviour before Virata and the crowning episode of the proposal for
Abhimanyu’s marriage with Uttara, Virata’s daughter (as Bhasa puts it.
“Gograhanasulkartham,” for Arjuna’s valour in redeeming national honour and
self-respect). Similarly again, the account of the discomfited Kaurava
warriors, with their unsuccessful attempt to ignore the identity of the
Pandavas, and painfully convinced by noting Arjuna’s name on the arrow prostrating
before Drona,–all these events on the Hastinavati front, ending with an
invitation for Abhimanyu’s marriage, follow one another in quick dramatic
succession. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
“Madhyama Vyayoga” and the “Dutaghactotkacha” need not detain us long, since
these have no epic background; but the livelinees and the subtle humour of
these plays is entirely Bhasa’s. The deviations in the “Urubhanga” have been
noted to a certain extent already. Bhasa might have received his basic plot
from the Epic, but the development is peculiarly Bhasa’s and we may confidently
assert that Bhasa foreshadows Bhavabhuti in his delineation of Karna. It is not
unfair to suggest that both Bhatta Narayana. and Bhavabhuti have followed in
the footsteps of Bhasa in respect of their delineations of “Veera” and “Karuna
rasas”. Now, according to the Epic, Balarama is </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>mightily angered
against Bhima for his hitting Duryodhana below the navel against rules and
kicking him on his crowned head. Sri Krishna tries to convince Balarama, but
Bala cries fie upon Bhima and straight-way proceeds to Dwarakn. But Bhasa’s
Balarama stays on right till the end; he remains in the background when
Dhritarashtra, Gandhari, Duryodhana’s two wives (not one as in the Epic), and
Durjaya, Duryodhana’a son (not referred to in the Epic), lament Duryodhana’s
fate. He overhears Asvathama’s vainglorious boast and departs for Dwaraka just
at the time when Duryodhana’s soul departs to the other world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
“Dutavakya” and the “‘Karnabhara” remain to be noticed. </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
“Dutavakya” dramatises the story of Krishna’s efforts at reconciliation and the
story, though based on the Epic, develops entirely on new lines. To insult the
ambassador, Duryodhana is purposely looking at a picture of Draupadi
Vastrapaharana after ordering that none should get up to honour Krishna. But
Krishna’s majestic personality makes every one get up, and, when Duryodhana
pretends to be absorbed. Krishna, pointedly asks him why he is seated and
Duryodhana is suddenly thrown off his balance. He somehow composes himself and
continues to gaze at the picture alone; It attracts Krishna’s attention also
for a brief second because of artistic beauty, but Krishna understands the
purport of the picture and chides Duryodhana for looking at a picture wherein
the insult of one’s own kith and kin is delineated. He even orders that the
picture be removed at once. Duryodhana dares not even protest, and Krishna
dominates the entire scene after this initial triumph. Duryodhana insinuatingly
asks whether the various sons of the ‘Gods’ are keeping good health. Pretending
not to understand the insinuation, Krishna rejoices at Duryodhana’s
affectionate enquiries, and asks the latter to surrender to the Pandavas their
patrimony. Duryodhana put the former insinuation more plainly, since he declares
that these are not the sons of his uncle Pandu, but are the progeny raised on
his aunt Kunti by the various gods, since his uncle was himself denied sexual
enjoyment with his wife by a curse. Even otherwise, he seems to suggest that,
by the law of primogeniture then prevailing, he as the eldest representative of
the elder line (or the eldest among all the brothers as explained already) is
entitled to the entire kingdom. Krishna at once retorts that his father’s
father Vichitravirya died of consumption and Dhritarashtra was raised by Vyasa
on Vichitravirya’s wife, and, if Duryodhana’s argument were to be conceded,
even Dhritarashtra could not inherit the kingdom. This naturally leads to some </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>personal
recrimination, and Krishna finally remarks that he should not deny their
patrimony to the Pandavas. Duryodhana retorts that kingdoms are not begged for,
but conquered, and so the Pandavas must fight and show that they deserve to
rule. Duryodhana refuses to give even a piece of straw from his patrimony to
the Pandavas. When Krishna wants to frighten him by telling him how Arjuna had
fought with Siva and done similar other exploits, Duryodhana refuses to budge
an inch from his position and insults Krishna. The latter turns to depart when
Duryodhana calls Sakuni, Karna, Dussasana and others to bind him. They all
fail, and Duryodhana himself starts to do the same. Krishna exhibits his
Visvarupa and so many Krishnas manifest themselves; and the ropes with which
Duryodhana wanted to bind Krishna were found on the persons or the other kings
gathered in the audience-hall. The scene (in between verses 42 to 54) wherein
so many weapons, Sudarsana, Nandaka etc., manifest themselves is obviously
spurious, since they come and go without serving any purpose at all.
Dhritarashtra enters at this moment and prostrates before Krishna and asks him
to accept his hospitality. Krishna does the same and the One-Act play ends.
This vigorous Scene is entirely Bhasa’s own creation. The spirited conversation
between Krishna and Duryodhana is kept at an animated level. The Visvarupa
which Krishna exhibits is without a purpose in the original Epic, though he
might say there, “Alone I am a match for all the Kauravas,” since it was
exhibited there when Dhritarashtra abused his son for his desire to bind up
this mighty person. It was not exhibited as a practical retort to the Kauravas
actually trying to bind him. In Bhasa, the Visvarupa is the dramatic reply
Krishna gives to Duryodhana’s wicked action”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In the “Karnabhara”, the whole scene is depicted as
a conversation between Karna and Salya. This is entirely fictitious. The storty
of Karna’s learning the “astras” from Parasurama is exactly as the Epic. Indra
comes in at this moment, disguised as a Brahmin and prays for a mighty gift.
Here the Brahmin’s speaking Prakrit is rather strange and would fit in only on
the supposition that Bhasa lived before the time when the rule about a Brahmin
speaking Sanskrit alone had not as yet become rigid. In the Epic, Karna has
already been warned by the Sun about Indra’s proposed visit to him to deprive
him of the ear-ornaments which made him invincible; but in Bhasa’s Play, Karna
has no clue to the same and is taken by surprise when a Brahmin wants alms from
him. Karna himself tells him he will conquer the earth and give it, or a
thousand horses or elephants or cows if wanted, but Indra cleverly refuses such
gifts; Karna of his own accord promises him “whatever is prayed for”. Indra, in
disguise, asks Karna if he would part with “Kavacha” and the “Kundalas”. Salya
protests; in the original, Salya is not there by his side and the occasion also
is different. As a matter of fact, Bhasa’s story leads to a small confusion. If
Salya is there when Karna makes the gift to Indra, the context evidently should
be when he starts for his last fight with Arjuna. But the incident, as it is
recorded in the Epic, occurs in the Aranya Parva in the 311th chapter
(Kumbakonam edition) where Indra comes disguised as a Brahmin begging for the
Kundalas. In the 301st chapter Surya has already warned Karna in a dream about
the wily intentions of Indra on behalf of his son Arjuna, and when Indra
actually comes, Karna guesses the identity of the Brahmin when be refuses
kingdom or cows, or elephants. In the Epic, Salya rebukes Karna at every step,
whereas he does not do so here. He is represented as very helpful by Bhasa.
Karna even bargains with Indra, according to the Epic, as to what he could get
in exhange for such a strange gift. Indra at once jumps at the idea and gives a
“Shakti”, a powerful missile, by which he could kill one of the Pandava
warriors. But Bhasa’s Karna does not exhibit any such bargaining spirit. He
does not recognise Indra at the time and without a second thought, bestows the
Kundalas. It is only after he has departed with the Kundalas, that Salya draws
Karna’s attention to the fact that he has been deceived by Indra; but Karna
replied that he is happy since he has made even Indra beg at his door. At this
moment, a “devaduta” or Angel of Indra appears before Karna and requests, on
behalf of Indra, who has himself grown penitent for his having done a
treacherous deed, that Karna should accept “Shakti” by which he can kill one of
the Pandavaa. Karna’s first reaction is one of definite disapproval, since it
was not in his nature to accept anything in return for something given by him
in charity. But the “devaduta” cannot be so easily thwarted–he cleverly pleads
that a Brahmin’s request should always be complied with. Karna rather
unwillingly according to Bhasa’s story, accepts the gift and departs for his
‘last’ fight with Arjuna. As we remarked already there may be a small
inconsistency, since the “Shakti” was already with Karna. For, according to the
Epic story, Ghatotkacha was killed with it and Bhasa knows it too. But Bhasa has
closed his eye towards this chronological inconsistency and ennobled the
character of Karna. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The last to be considered is the “Balacharita”. It
must have been one of the earliest dramas, since it does not exhibit the
maturity of thought so characteristic of Bhasa. The “Bhagavata Purana,” or even
the earlier “Harivamsa” or the “Vishnupurana” does not seem to have been as yet
composed, and Bhasa’s story seems to follow some earlier basic “Purana” or
possibly some Buddhist “Jataka.” The deviations are not introduced with the
desire of ennobling any Character. Krishna is here the seventh child, not the
eighth; a Madhuka Rishi’s curse predicts Kamsa’s death and not the “asareerinee
vak” or heavenly voice as in the “Bhagavata.” In a Kannada Jaina Purana, called
“Neminathana Parana,” the story proceeds on similar lines, and though this
“Purana” edited by our Madras University is composed by one Karnaparya, a Jain,
in the 11th century A.D., it seems to have had a far earlier source, perhaps in
the beginning of the Christian era, if not earlier.</p>

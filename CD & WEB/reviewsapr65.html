style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
has been no more compelling or controversial figure in Indian politics in
recent years than V. K. Krishna Menon. Some are passionately devoted to him,
while others are strongly allergic to him, but none can afford to ignore him as
a force in world affairs after Indian Independence. He is one of the two most
powerful personalities thrown up from the <span class=SpellE>Malabar</span>
Coast into the large arena of national affairs, the other being Sir C. <span
class=SpellE>Sankaran</span> <span class=SpellE>Nair</span> four decades before
him. While the average person from that part of India is known for a certain
flair for survival amidst strangers, far from his place of birth, derived from
a spirit of accommodation and capacity for adjustment, these two stand out in
addition, by their toughness and resilience and the propensity to put up a
fight for what they thought right, against any individuals or institutions who
might deny them their due. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the case of Krishna Menon, it is but fair to remember that though the world
began to take him into account only some years after India had won her freedom,
he had been wearing himself out in her cause for nearly a quarter of a century
before that in England where he went as a student and stayed on till his
mission was fulfilled. Two or three characteristics stand out in the make up of
his personality from his early years. They are: his sharp intellect,
seriousness of purpose and utter-sense or dedication. His father, a leading
member of the legal profession in <span class=SpellE>Cannanore</span>, was
hoping against hope that his worthy son would follow in his footsteps and
inherit his extensive practice. But the son had ideas of his own, and ideals
too, not always in keeping with parental decree. Two major influences were the
deciding factors on the course of his entire life in his youth and early
manhood. One was that of Dr. <span class=SpellE>Besant</span> under whose
guidance he became a Scout Master, discontinuing his legal studies in <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City>, and devoted
himself to the task of inculcating discipline in the minds of the youth of his
day. The second was that of Prof. Harold J. <span class=SpellE>Laski</span> at
the London School of Economics, where he learned his first lessons in
socialism, in addition to those of national freedom. The third and final
influence, which came to him in the years of his full maturity, was that of
Jawaharlal Nehru whom he met closely enough in the early thirties, though they
did meet earlier, more than once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Nehru–Menon relationship, marked by an admirable steadfastness till the <span
class=SpellE>former’s</span> death, was more in the nature of a meeting of
like-minds rather than that of master and disciple, mentor and seeker or patron
and <span class=SpellE>protege</span>. If Nehru was the first Indian leader in
this country to help create a world consciousness in India (along with <span
class=SpellE>Subhas</span> <span class=SpellE>Bose</span> in his own way),
Menon was certainly the only Indian colleague who shared Nehru’s international
outlook in full, and reinforced it with specific data on the actual state of
affairs in Europe and the struggle for freedom among the colonial peoples. It
is beyond any doubt that they were always en rapport with one another, making due
allowance for the possible differences of emphasis in the mode of accent,
depending on peculiarities of temperament and early background in each case. In
addition to arranging the publication of Nehru’s books <i>Glimpses of World
History</i>, and <i>Unity of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
</i>Menon was, for a time, the London Correspondent of the <i>National Herald </i>(a
fact which had obviously escaped the biographer’s notice, in spite of the
lynx-eyed search for data). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
biographer’s job is by no means easy, in view of the studied indifference with
which he is likely to be treated by a man of <span class=SpellE>Menon’s</span>
imperious temperament, who tends to look upon all biographies as a terrible
waste of time. It is creditable that we learn so much about all the stages of <span
class=SpellE>Menon’s</span> career from the author, a journalist of experience,
who knows where to go in for his facts and how to set them in their proper
perspective. The years in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">London</st1:place></st1:City>,
full of blood, toil, tears and sweat, make an absorbing chapter in this
readable account. A work schedule of 18 hours a day with nothing more than a
piece of bun or a couple of biscuits and endless cups of strong tea to sustain
oneself was not unusual with Menon, who seems to have been a fiend for work,
when once his enthusiasm is aroused. He is also a man who knew no fear (like Nehru)
who could go on working in bombed <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">London</st1:place></st1:City>,
with splinters and smashed windows around him, as if nothing had happened. The
story of his life in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">London</st1:place></st1:City>,
devoted to the cause of Indian freedom is one of complete dedication, which was
proof against neglect, suspicion and hostility, in addition to the <span
class=SpellE>rigours</span> of poverty. He was not quite free from these, when
he stayed on in <st1:City w:st="on">London</st1:City> after his term as <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s first
High Commissioner. The author depicts <span class=SpellE>Menon’s</span> vital
role in the transition to freedom, when he stayed close to Nehru at every
stage. His work as <span class=SpellE>Defence</span> Minister is assessed with
sympathy and understanding, including his unsuccessful plan to settle with the
aggressor by an exchange of territory. Even his unpopularity in the wake of the
Chinese aggression is explained, but on the whole, the book cannot avoid the
impression of being an intelligent apology rather than a balanced estimate. But
it does give vivid glimpses of a <span class=SpellE>colourful</span>, if
baffling, personality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of <span class=SpellE>Sankaran</span> <span class=SpellE>Nair</span>. He
belonged to a generation for which loyalty to the British crown (Queen <st1:State
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Victoria</st1:place></st1:State> was still
firmly established in the Indian pantheon) was not incompatible with the love
for one’s own country and the fight for her freedom. <span class=SpellE>Sankaran</span>
<span class=SpellE>Nair</span>, like <span class=SpellE>Besant</span> and Salem
<span class=SpellE>Vijayaraghavachariar</span> and others of the day, was for a
strictly constitutional fight, which stopped short of civil disobedience,
non-violent though it <span class=GramE>be</span>. The entry of Gandhi on the
active political scene as the leader of the first civil disobedience in 1921
marks the exit of Sir C. <span class=SpellE>Sankaran</span> <span class=SpellE>Nair</span>
from the Indian National Congress. The latter’s book entitled <i>Gandhi and
Anarchy </i>got him not only into <span class=SpellE>disfavour</span> with the
whole body of congressmen but led to a libel suit from Sir Michael <span
class=SpellE>O’Dwyer</span>, which he lost; at heavy cost to himself, for no
real fault of his own. He was a man of stubborn independence and unbending
integrity who made no compromises with his own self-respect. He resigned from
the Viceroy’s Executive Council during the Martial Law Administration in the <st1:place
w:st="on">Punjab</st1:place>, earning the gratitude of whole nation. While he
admired the discipline and character of the Englishman, he never truckled to
the prejudices of the white-man, claiming the fear and respect of the latter in
the long run. As a Judge, he was for a liberal interpretation of the Hindu Law,
which was but in keeping with his policy of social reform. The booklet in
tribute is well documented, though its obvious tone of veneration, in which any
criticism would be sacrilege, detracts from its merit as a political or
personal biography. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But,
as the author points out in the introduction, there are irreconcilable
contradictions, puzzling obscurities and glaring in-consistencies of attitude
in his prose as well as poetical writings which baffle the readers. Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Hoskot</span> <span class=SpellE>endeavours</span>, by a close
study and careful analysis of the writings, and the mind and personality of the
author revealed therein, with particular reference to the environment and
background of his career, to establish that the contradictions in his writings
are connected with inherent contradictions and conflicts in Eliot’s mind and
the way he adopted to attain integrity of being and outlook. It is not quite
clear that his diagnosis of the conflict in the mind and personality of Eliot
is correct and based on established facts. The references to ‘the experience of
love-<span class=SpellE>ecstacy</span> early in his life’ and the burden of a
lacerating sense of guilt or inner treachery which his pride prevented him from
confessing too plainly’ are laconic and casually introduced, not clearly
explained or substantiated; but his elaboration of the spiritual evolution of
Eliot, based on the diagnosis, and traced through his writings, is both
interesting and instructive. It is no doubt an original interpretation and a
valuable contribution to literary criticism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
criticism is throughout <span class=SpellE>characterised</span> by sympathetic
understanding, discriminating insight, originality of interpretation and
boldness in presentation. Mr. <span class=SpellE>Hoskot</span> rightly points
out that the value of Eliot’s work depends not on the relevance and validity of
his argument and doctrine, but on the material of personal feelings and
experience of life actually lived, which they <span class=SpellE>rationalise</span>
and to which they give emphatic form. He <span class=SpellE>emphasises</span>
further that it is the presence of this material, this body of feelings and
impulses, intense and conflicting that gives unity to Eliot’s poetry, He
accounts for the profound impression Eliot has made on his contemporaries as
due to the powerful expression he has given to the feeling of utter emptiness
in modern industrial civilisation which is the characteristic mood of sensitive
modern men, his extraordinary command over the musical and associational values
of words and his mastery of a variety of metrical effects. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=SpellE>Hoskot</span> does not concede any value to the social
criticism in the prose writings of Eliot. “Those who seek in the prose works
(of Eliot) any <span class=SpellE>formulable</span> standards, or a
clarification of ideals for the future, or a more exact way of defining their
discontent with contemporary institutions, will be disappointed…These writings
are generally deficient in two important virtues of good prose-sustained
logical argument and exhaustive analysis.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
offers only qualified praise even to the literary criticism in the writings of
Eliot. He concedes that ‘Eliot is capable of great depth of penetration within
a certain field of experience’ but, he points out, ‘His convictions make for
narrowness of outlook….certain orders of experience he cannot
understand….certain orders of charity in moral judgment he cannot compass.’ <o:p></o:p></span></p>

contribution to the critical literature on Eliot, the great modern poet, and a
creditable achievement for an Indian writer on English literature. It deserves

the love episode of a <span class=SpellE><i>chandala</i></span> girl that fell
in love with <span class=SpellE>Ananda</span>, a self-restrained and unyielding
young sage and disciple of Buddha. The girl tried to win over his love with the

duel between <span class=SpellE><i>tantric</i></span> and spiritual powers,
wherein at last the latter held their sway, and the girl herself took to the
order of <span class=SpellE>Buddhistic</span> Nuns. The poem is full of pretty,
appropriate and suggestive descriptions of nature and mental conflicts,
expressed in sweet and chaste language, and is a very good feast for the heart
and mind. The poet, however, ought to have shown, in a more detailed manner,
the gradual transition of love into renunciation, in order to avoid criticism
from a fastidious critic. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

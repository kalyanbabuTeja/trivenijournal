<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Armistice
talks have been going on in Korea for more two years. It appeared at one time
that they would end stalemate as a consequence of disagreement on the issue of
repatriation of prisoners of war. But at long last this now been satisfactorily
settled as between the two main parties–the United Nations on one side, the
North Koreans and the Chinese on the other. It was settled between them that
the prisoners unwilling to be repatriated should be handed over to a
five-nation Neutral Commission presided over by India, that those who were
opposed to repatriation even after being handled by this Commission should be
made over to the Political Conference to be set up within ninety days after the
conclusion of the armistice, and those who continued to be opposed to
repatriation even after that should be finally disposed of by the United
Nations. There is no need to go into all the details of this settlement. It is
enough to observe that some settlement satisfactory to both parties was arrived
at, and it was the expectation of the whole world that the armistice would be
actually signed on 25th 1953, the fourth anniversary of the outbreak of the
Korean War. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
this did not happen, and at the time of writing there was no clear proof that
the armistice would be concluded in the near future. This is due to a
difficulty having cropped up in a most unexpected quarter. Dr. Syngman Rhee has
taken on himself, as the President of the South Korean Republic, the
responsibility to sabotage the armistice talks. Contrary to the settlement
agreed to, he liberated from U. N. custody twenty-seven thousand prisoners who
should have been rightly handed over to the Neutral Commission. He has not
stopped with this. He has stated that he is against all armistice, that war
should go on until the Communists are defeated in the field and Korea unified
under his Government. He has even threatened to fight single-handed against
North Korea, even if the U. N. forces were to withdraw from the scene of
warfare. All this is due to the fact that in the execution of the American plan
to make Asians fight Asians, they put in the possession of Dr. Rhee a Korean
army of half a million well-trained and well-equipped men, and these now constitute
nearly seventy-five per cent of the U. N. forces fighting the North Koreans and
the Chinese.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
question therefore that arises is whether the Communists would agree to an
armistice under circumstances like these. Their hope that the prisoners of war,
now unwilling to be repatriated, could after being handed over<i> </i>to the
Neutral Commission be persuaded to favour repatriation is now gone. It is quite
possible that even those who are now in the prisoners’ camps may be liberated
before the actual armistice is signed. All this would mean the Communists
losing face in regard to a question on which they put up a determined fight for
two years. They may also begin to feel that, with Dr. Rhee as the Head of the
South Korean Republic, there was no guarantee that the terms of the armistice
would be kept. The conduct therefore of Dr. Rhee has placed the North Korean
and the Chinese Governments in a dilemma.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is no doubt true that, after the death of Stalin and the reversal of his
policies by his successors, there is a real desire for peace in the Communist
camp. The Korean War has not brought victory to them. It has only ended in a
military stalemate. There is no prospect of their being able to secure control
over South Korea through a military campaign now. Even if they think of war
later for achieving this objective, they must have time to recuperate their
strength. Then there are also the larger and more important issues. The war has
cost them two million casualties. It has been a drain on the resources of
China. The Chinese Government feels that continuance of war will make it more
dependent on Soviet Russia, and that it will delay the industrialisation of the
country and the general economic reconstruction on which it is bent. It is
therefore quite possible that, influenced by considerations like these, they
may reconcile themselves to the treachery of Dr. Rhee and sign the armistice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
may be persuaded to do so by Soviet<i> </i>Russia. The Soviet embarked on the
Korean adventure in the spirit of a gambler. Unfortunately the gamble led to
unwelcome results. Not only was there no victory in Korea but the Korean crisis
has led to the increasing domination of the United States in Western Europe–the
one result which the Soviet authorities wanted to prevent. It was the Korean
crisis that strengthened the Atlantic Treaty Organisation and brought under its
control a well-organised and well-equipped army commanded by a United States
general. It laid the foundations of a European Defence Community, of which a
revived and restored Western Germany with its human and material resources is
to be an integral part. It has led to British and American rearmament on a
large scale, so that today the American bloc is from a defence point of view
much stronger than what it was before the Korean crisis. The Soviet gamble has
failed and the Soviet statesmen are now anxious for peace in Korea, so that
they may be free to achieve their aims through diplomacy and through
negotiation. There does not seem to be any doubt as to the sincerity with which
they are making their efforts for a peaceful solution of outstanding issues,
and this is sure to make the Communists in North Korea and their Chinese allies
sign the armistice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Such
an armistice seems to be all the more necessary for Soviet Russia from other
standpoints also. The situation in </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Eastern Germany is not
today so bright as it was before the death of Stalin. The new rulers of Soviet
Russia feel that pure Communism cannot be a success there. They have now
abandoned some of their essential social and economic policies in that region
and made the Communist regime, which they set up there, issue statements to the
effect that it committed errors in the past. Private capitalist enterprise is
now being encouraged. Collectivisation of agriculture has peen stopped. In
spite of this the situation in East Berlin and Eastern Germany has become
volcanic. There have been labour strikes on an unprecedented scale. If a
comparison has to be instituted, the situation in East Germany today is just
like the opposition to Napoleon which started in Spain when he was practically
at the height of his power and which was the beginning of the collapse of his
empire. East Germany may prove to be the Achilles’ heel of Soviet Russia. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
has long been the policy of Soviet statesmen to prevent the integration of
Western Germany into the West European Defence system. This policy has not
undergone a change after the death of Stalin. Only it is taking a new shape and
form. They are now anxious that a United Germany which will keep aloof from the
West European Defence system–a sort of a neutral or a buffer State in Central
Europe–is created. They prefer this to forcible communisation of Eastern
Germany which will be permanently separated from a democratic Western Germany.
Their cry therefore now is German unity. Under the changed circumstances
brought about by the reversal of their policies in Eastern Germany this cry is
having its effect. It is weakening the hold </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of Chancellor Adenauer
and his party in Western Germany and </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>strengthening that of
the Social Democrats who are not over-enthusiastic about West European unity.
It looks therefore the Soviet rulers are anxious to have their hands freed from
the difficulties in Korea so that they may pay more attention to the affairs of<i>
</i>Europe. What they want is a sort of respite from the strain created by
Stalin’s cold war. It is this that explains their friendly attitude towards
Tito with whom they have exchanged ambassadors and the political assurances
which they have given to Turkey in recent weeks. Their attitude towards Austria
is also more conciliatory. All these may be taken as indications to show that
Soviet Russia will persuade China and North Korea to sign the armistice in
spite of the dishonourable behaviour of Dr. Rhee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>But what about the United States? The dilemma in
which her Government is placed is much more serious. Of course the large
majority of the people of the United States are anxious for an armistice. They
do not want that more American lives should be lost in the defence of South
Korea. But there is a section among them which sympathises with the stand taken
by Dr. Rhee. It is the same section as has been sympathising with
Chiang-Kai-Shek. They are not in the least perturbed by the idea of a large
scale war against Communist China, with Formosa and South Korea as the military
bases for the purpose. They are not without influence on President Eisenhower.
The latter has now to decide whether in the face of the opposition of Dr. Rhee
he should authorise his representatives to sign the armistice. This will depend
on what he thinks of the possibility of Dr. Rhee giving effect to his threat to
fight, North Korea single-handed to achieve the unification of the country. If
in spite of the armistice Dr. Rhee starts such a fight, he is sure to be
defeated. But will it be to the interest of the United States to see that he is
defeated and all Korea brought under Communist control? This is why all efforts
are now being made by the United States to somehow bring round Dr. Rhee to
accept the armistice. He may be brought round, provided that the United States
enters into a military pact with him guaranteeing all aid to him in case
another effort at aggression is made by North Korea. Some such guarantee will
have to be given to him, and it will be given as there is no other alternative.
There is no prospect whatever of Dr. Rhee being replaced by any other
Government in South Korea.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
may therefore be concluded that an armistice may soon become an accomplished
fact in Korea. This view is further strengthened by the attitude of the other
participants on<i> </i>the U. N. side in the war against North Korea. Almost
all of them are in favour of an armistice. This was prominently brought out<i> </i>by
the Commonwealth Premiers’ Conference held recently in London. </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
the Premiers welcomed the armistice. They also welcomed the suggestion of Sir
Winston Churchill for a Big-Power meeting and talks to settle as many
outstanding issues as possible. No one therefore is anxious to have the
armistice talks break down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt'>It should not
of course be assumed that the conclusion of an armistice in Korea will end
world tensions and the cold war. As a matter of fact there are many Americans
who feel that it may lead only to more dissensions, not only as between the East
and the West but also as between the “free” nations outside the Communist
bloc–tensions which are now lying latent because of the Korean crisis. A peace
conference will have to be called and many issues will have to be solved. But
on most of these issues the views of the United States are very much different
from those held by some of her important allies–notably England and France–and
by some of the important neutral States like India. There is a large section in
the United States which feels that the open discussion of these differences may
result in a breach in the defence system which they have been building against
Communistic expansionism during the last seven years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt'>Among these
issues is the admission of Communist China into the U.N.O. This occupies an
important place among them. The Senate of the United States recently passed an
unanimous resolution that there should be no such admission, and it would be
difficult for the United States representative to vote for such admission when
the question comes up before the Security Council. He will be compelled to veto
it. The United Kingdom however is for admitting China. Of course India has
always fighting for it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt'>There is next
the question of Formosa. There can be settlement of the Far Eastern issues unless
Formosa is incorporated in Communist China. But the United States is determined
to oppose it. Here again England and India differ from the United States.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

agreement between the parties. United Korea under a Communist government is an </span><span

the subject of the West European Defence system also there are divergent
views–views which have so far delayed the ratification of the European Defence
Treaties. Here the divergence is mainly between France and the United States. A
rearmed Western Germany incorporated into the defence system is anathema to
France, and the United States cannot think of such a system without Germany
being a part of it. European defence against Soviet aggression and the spread
of Communism has, in the view of the United States, no meaning unless German
man-power is included in it. A United Germany as proposed by Soviet Russia is
not from her viewpoint a more desirable alternative. Thus neither in the East
nor in the West will world tensions be removed or even weakened with the
conclusion of the Korean armistice. The cold war is bound to continue and every
country will be pestered by the intrigues and counter-intrigues initiated by
the two world powers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
may be a point for consideration whether some Americans may not argue against
armistice in Korea, if armistice does not serve the purpose of putting an end
to the cold war and the hidden menace of international Communism of which they
are mortally afraid. One should not lose sight of such an argument. They may be
stimulated to support it on the ground that it may be left to Dr. Rhee and
Chiang-Kai-Shaik equipped with American arms to fight it out, with the United
States watching the situation from a distance. This was just what Soviet Russia
did when on June 25, 1950 she encouraged North Korea to launch her attack on
South Korea. It took three years for her to realise that this gamble was a
failure. There will be nothing surprising if Americans now begin to imitate
Soviet Russia in this respect and instigate their proteges–Dr. Rhee and Chiang,
to try their strength against the Communists. A policy like this may be pursued
even if an armistice is concluded between the U.N. forces on one side and the
Communist forces on the other. One of the great discoveries of Stalinism was
the effectiveness of Civil Wars in the march of international Communism towards
world conquest. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

may now be made to the other tensions in the world. The situation in Indo-China
shows no signs of improvement. On the other hand it has become worse in
consequence of the activities of the King of Cambodia who is now actively
demanding for the States in Indo-China–the so-called associated States of the
French Union–the same status as India has in the Commonwealth of Nations. This
is a legitimate demand, and without conceding it France will never be able to
get on in Indo-China. It is time that the United States brings sufficient
pressure to bear on France and tells her that no solution of the Indo-China
problem is possible unless the independence of Indo-China is recognised. If
what the United States wants is the “containment” of Communism, she can succeed
in such a policy if she takes up the cause of Nationalism. Otherwise she will
have to fight not only Communism but also Nationalism. The recent tour of John
Foster Dulles round the countries of Asia must have brought this conviction to
him, if his countrymen had not already been convinced of it. There is no
meaning in a third rate power like France with a dwindling population twice
defeated by Germany, trying to impose her authority on a people who are
prepared to sacrifice everything for freedom, and the attempt becomes still
more meaningless when her domestic situation is so disrupted that for weeks together
she is not able to get a stable ministry. A graceful withdrawal from her
colonial territories would prove doubly advantageous to her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is the situation in respect of the Anglo-Egyptian dispute over the Suez Canal.
Egypt has now become a Republic with General Naguib as her first President. He
and his revolutionary council are not prepared to yield even by an inch in
their demand that Britain should evacuate the Canal. It is their faith that
then alone does Egypt become really sovereign. The British are not prepared to
evacuate, as they think that there is no other spot from which they can
organise the defence of the Middle East against Soviet aggression. It is the
British fear of Communist expansion that stands in the way of their coming to a
friendly understanding with Egyptian nationalism. John Foster Dulles didn’t
succeed in his recent visit to Cairo in bringing about reconciliation between
the parties. Even the efforts of Pandit Nehru and Premier Mohammad Ali of
Pakistan have not met with a </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:

is now becoming more and more clear that unless the neutral nations of the
world–neutral in the sense that they ardently desire peace and non-intervention
by the two great world-powers–form themselves into a third bloc and treat the
so-called world powers as “untouchables” would wisdom dawn on those powers and
make them see the folly of each of them preparing for war against the other.
Concentration of power is much more dangerous than concentration of wealth.
There is no freedom for small and middling nations so long as there is such
concentration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

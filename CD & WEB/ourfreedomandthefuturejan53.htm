The freedom of a nation connotes or ought to connote the freedom of each
individual within it to perfect his personality. The extent of liberty of an
individual to so perfect his personality is the measure of the freedom of the
nation to which he belongs. Such liberty, it goes<i> </i>without saying,
relates both to within and without. Internal inhibitions may detract from
liberty no less than external restraints. Fascism is as much a bar to liberty
as foreign domination.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

rise to the desire for immortality might itself give man his immortality, by
making him dissolve himself in matter in utter self-abandonment. In its perfect

Gandhi’s self- identification with everything that lives. For matter alone is

from its base in the Himalayas, India settles down in the plains of Uttar
Pradesh. The civilisation of which Upper India bears so many remarkable
imprints is called upon to settle account with the still older civilisation of
the South. Even at this moment the contest is evident on the question of a
national language. Both are however confronted with the emotional stirs of
alluvial Bengal, while tribal-cum migratory patterns of life present the North-Eastern
State of Assam in a yet uncertain setting. Currents of thought–and now not only
of thought but also of life and movement–filter down into the great country
where for two hundred years medievalism hung on to foreign rule for
perpetuation of itself beyond the period historically determined for it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

has indeed taken a heavy toll. The price it has exacted for clearing the way
for India to work out her path ahead has been heavy indeed. A deluge of blood
has occurred and the Indian sub-continent has been divided on a basis of
religious Nationalism which has really proved to be communalism raised to the
status of Nationalism. India has not accepted the theory of two nations based
on religion but had to agree to secession of Muslim-majority areas to form a
separate State. Communalism now can remain, and actually remains, only as
oppression of the minority community by the majority community. It has not
ceased to exist in that form even in India; and that was why Pandit Nehru as
President of the Congress was led in the last General Elections to lay prior
emphasis on the eradication of communalism. That surprised not a few, and many
thought that Pandit Nehru was overdoing the crusade against communalism. The
rout of communalism in the elections was held to show that Pandit Nehru had
been fighting a ghost. It is by no means certain however that the fight was not
necessary for laying the ghost. It is again by no means certain that those who
consider Pandit Nehru’s crusade against communalism uncalled for do not, at
least subconsciously, wish him to leave their own communalism undis</span><span

sheer weight of the numbers involved is a phenomenon. It might be an
exaggeration to say that this is a picture of democracy in action, for
democracy is the fulfillment of certain concepts which can, if at all in a
dynamic world, be achieved only in the course of time. Yet modern elections are
the only practicable device which man has so far contrived to express the will
of the people. A demonstration of that will is indeed a heartening promise of a
people’s awakening and their resolve to participate in the ordering of their
country. Moreover the fairness of the elections is noteworthy…..These elections

international relations, the USA has been particularly impressed by it.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

destiny for India. It is eminently in accord with, and a fulfillment of, the
synthetic trend of India’s history, of which paradoxically the best
exemplification is the peak of the Muslim period, <i>i.e., </i>from Baburto
Shahjehan. Fatehpur Sikri is the abiding representation of the synthesis of
cultures represented by the tomb of a Hindu Yogi side by side with the abode of

S. Eliot wrote sometime ago that culture could be saved in India either by
letting the States develop their distinctive cultures in free conformity with
the national being, or by enforcing a sort of rigid conformity. The latter
course, he took care to add, was not at all feasible, for it would involve the
elimination of classes and the abolition of religion which would be the end of
culture itself–for religion, Eliot maintained, was the foundation of culture. A
common religious background, he said, was essential for the development of
culture. Conflict would be a hindrance to such development, and the two
ways–really one–that he suggested were for resolving possible conflict.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Eliot
also made the rather astonishing observation that partition of the country had
removed the danger of cultural conflict. That should surprise many, not only as
being support for partition from an unexpected quarter, but support based on
exactly the same ground that protagonists of Pakistan most relied on. For India
to admit this ground as valid would be to disown her national ideal which is in
the present context connoted, as the aforesaid Pakistani paper has noticed, by
secularism, India has never accepted the explanation of her communal problem in
terms of supposed cultural differences between Hindus and Muslims. It may be
over-simplification to ascribe the problem in terms of supposed cultural
differences between Hindus and Muslims. It may be over-simplification to
ascribe the problem to the manoeuvre of the imperialist third party that ruled
the country. But that would be no justification for reading into it more
meaning than is reasonable and in accord with facts judging the problem
objectively, it may be recalled that the demand for Pakistan was a demand for a
homeland for Indian Muslims. Scientifically speaking it was a demand of the
rising Muslim middle class, under the aegis of the semi-feudal Muslim upper
class, for a political and economic haven of their own. The demand had the
support of the Muslim masses as well, for they had no other leadership than
that of their own upper class to follow. Also they followed it willingly
because the economic power which rested, because of historical reasons, largely
in the hands of Hindus and was in its own nature oppressively used, could be
and was shown in a communal light. That a politico-economic demand arose in a
communal form needs to be accounted for. It is easily ascribable to the
perpetuation of medievalism in our body-politic, due to industrialisation
having been held over and modern scientific knowledge and outlook debarred from
our national life, by foreign colonial rule. The consequent lack of a modern
scientific outlook perpetuated communalism. The colonial ruling power was of
Course too willing to take advantage of–and fan the flames of–communalism. But
it would be giving communalism too much weight to ascribe it to cultural
difference. Indeed no culture or, for that matter of that, no religion (Eliot
says culture is derived of religion) would own to reacting on another culture
in the way that led to admittedly one of the greatest barbaric cataclysms in
history. Certainly no culture could be made responsible for the unspeakable
inhumanity which communalism has inflicted on millions of this sub-continent.</p>

culture in the classical sense is derived from religion, <i>i.e., </i>from a
teleological view of life. Conflicts between outer forms and patterns of
culture, arising out of different religions, could be and were often subdued
under a stable politico-social order. Such an order prevailed during the rule
of Babur to Shahjehan. Then the synthetic trend of our cultural history was
continuous. Aurangzeb departed from that trend and his religio-cultural separatism
was responsible for that loss of popular assent to his rule which steadily
resulted in the decline of Mughal power in India. Hence Aurangazeb </span><span

is not intended here to make any Chauvinistic claim on India’s behalf. For the
sake of<i> </i>mere survival she has had to make a synthetic effort with the
cultures and civilisations which a steady series of inroads and invasions have
brought within her doors. Not many other countries have been historically
similarly placed. Again it is not to be supposed that the synthetic
individuality of Indian culture is something static or uniform for all time.
Rather it is achieved by resolution, from age to age, of the conflict between
the classical and popular trends of culture which are seen simultaneously running
through Indian history. Classical Indian culture rests on Brahminism and would
simply shut out all alien modes of thought. It is the <i>summum bonum </i>of
Brahminical class ascendancy, tides of revolt against which have surged through
history. These have brought with them floods of cultural fruition of which
Buddhist art and architecture are the most solid example. Vaishnavite songs and
literature rank next in order of popular self-expression in the wake of social
revolution. There are other sectional forms of worship that are a living
protest against the rigours of orthodoxy and have found exuberant release in
song and dance. Politico-cultural conflicts like these are not India’s
specialty, but they have been conspicuous in her varied historical context. Unorthodox
and to some extent uncongenial cultural movements could not certainly have been
assimilated except in the course of resolution of such conflicts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

this process of assimilation in the history of India, the reign of Aurangzeb,
as has been said before, has been described as an interlude. It was the
anti-thesis of the whole trend and purpose of Indian history towards cultural
assimilation. Yet it would be wishful to describe it merely as an interlude, <i>i.
e, </i>an episode that is ended. Such an interlude would not have been possible
except on the background of religio-culrural conflict and contradiction which
Aurangzeb thought fit to sharpen rather than assuage. Again, had it been merely
an interlude, there need have been no Pakistan. The establishment of Pakistan
proves that seeds of dissension have continued to exist and operate and have
sprouted into a State formed by the secession of Muslim-majority areas from the
mainland. Even with the establishment of a separate State, however, factors of
dissension have not ceased to exist. Rather, Pakistan is an embodiment of the
gospel of<i> </i>dissension. But it has not incorporated unto itself all the
separatism that was in the country. Separatism is evident even in India, in
incidents not all of which are the making of any one community. Separatism
results in communalism and finds expression, apart from specific incidents, in
many a subtle way. In day-to-day behaviour and ordinary procedure in varied
spheres of life, it not infrequently reveals itself. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the political plane in India, however, communal separatism has, as the
aforesaid Pakistani paper has observed, met with defeat. For, there it has no
practical advantage to show. In the personal and social spheres, it may yet
linger. But inasmuch as it is ceasing to be a collective force, it is losing
its relation unto the broad purposes of life. At this stage, however, the broad
purposes of life themselves do intervene. They seek out ways of expression and
fulfillment, and in course of time transcend such unrealities as communalism.
In the background, abiding values like humanism do exist and operate. The
miracle in humanism that Mahatma Gandhi worked in riot-ravaged Calcutta in the
wake of independence would, in the light of subsequent events, appear to be but
a fleeting phenomenon. Yet it has been something of a permanent quality in
men’s souls ever since. Lives were sacrificed in support of it, and not in
vain. In its molecular working it has steeled the people’s subconscious minds
against communal riots involving whole communities on a sort of war basis.
Communal riots since then have been brought about by organisation, not in any
spontaneous manner. It has since then not been possible to rally the whole
population in support of communalism in which they had hitherto been actively
or passively involved. The martyrdom of Mahatma Gandhi set the seal of
permanence on the process of reclamation of Indian humanity from communalism.
Gandhian humanism has been a great though subconscious factor in the triumph of
secularism in the last elections.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

quest of a perpetual life is real and lends itself to the solace of hearing a
good song. If communalism survives independence, despair at what this
independence has meant is also inevitable. There is no easy way to fill in the
resultant vacuum. Independence has been supposed to mean an opportunity for
good living, good thinking, and freedom for human personality. Independence in
that sense is far from being realised. So it reaches out to new paths, new
endeavour. There is no clear-cut path either. Political parties offer their
programmes, not all of which are genuine. At any rate they take time to derive
reality out of practical and psychological integration with actual conditions
of life. Men and women in the meantime have their problems to solve, their
urges to satisfy. Very possibly it only results in frustration all round. The
social and personal aberrations of which people are so often heard to complain
these days, are a direct result. They nevertheless do not cloud the infinite
quality of human desire. Social and cultural impacts from the outside world–and
the world today is small, easily reachable–provide a ready though temporary
outlet. For, except for minds integrated unto international movements of
thought, they provide no day-to-day or permanent sustenance. Nor is more than a
minute fraction of the population called upon to partake of the spiritual and
intellectual entertainment thus available. In this the social iniquities are
seen grossly at work. The major part of the population is stunted and starved.
Social balance is lost. No wonder standards of life and society are all
topsy-turvy. Social and moral values are admittedly at a discount. One feels
one is not living. One feels one is dying. What avails freedom if one must die?
One cries for immortality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

what about the defeat registered by the synthetic spirit of India in the
establishment of Pakistan? There is no denying that this defeat has been
colossal. It has been the end of long cherished dreams of united India, the
fading out of visions of united Indian nationhood. The defeat has been all the
greater because it came with the suddenness of a shock. It would be
unscientific and useless to ascribe it to the artificial machinations of a
party or individual or–what would be greater over-simplification–a third party.
The causes of this defeat were latent in the history of India, and were of
course exploited by those who stood to gain thereby. When everything is said
and done, however, the fact remains that the synthetic tradition of India
failed the task of internal integration at the pour of withdrawal of foreign
imperialism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

if the quest for freedom continues in India, it has not stopped in Pakistan
either. Pakistan has not proved to the <i>summum bonum </i>that those who
wanted and realised it bargained for. The political set-up is as fluid as
elsewhere, for, opposition to the ruling party is strong and growing. All it
has attained<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>so far is an
administrative structure which alone cannot develop a national entity. A
national entity can be formed only unto a common social and cultural purpose.
Pakistan has not yet found any such purpose. Even the mutual integration of the
two parts of Pakistan is far from complete. Nay, the unresolved contradiction
between them has exploded into a tragedy over the question of a State language,
Quite a number of East Bengal youths have given their lives to have Bengali
recognised as one of the State languages of Pakistan. Many hundreds are in
detention over the same issue. Yet the question has been left unsolved. Nor is
there any clear answer to the query how the two wings of Pakistan will
culturally assimilate each other in the course and by way of the much promised
cultural self-fulfillment of that country. Present facts are the political
domination of East Pakistan by West Pakistan and the total lack of cultural
adjustment and understanding between the two. A common religion was formerly
claimed to be the foundation of a common culture. But as it has clearly proved
not enough, and as the Muslim world does not show even one example of solid
mutual integration on the basis of a common religion, the evangelists of
Pakistan have fallen back on the hope that the memory of a common fight against
the Hindus and the Congress–which fight is supposed to have won Pakistan–will
also produce a solid Pakistani culture. This reliance on a negative political
factor for cultural fruition is on the face of it naive. It will not work
unless culture could be made to order. Meanwhile, what are the facts? Political
regimentation in the name of an Islamic State, and orders for an Islamic
culture without any realistic approach thereto. Civil liberties are, in this
atmosphere, in eclipse. The result is a sense of suffocation leading on to
underground channels of feeling and organisation. Religious nationalism finds
its anti-thesis in anti-religious Communism. Frustration is writ large on the
faces of conscious youths of East Bengal. There also is a fear of not living,
of sure death. There also is a cry for<i> </i>immortality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

has come into our world, death has come into our lives. We have attained
independence. Yet why do we feel, both within and without ourselves, so
wretched? We must therefore make an attempt to live. We are the people. Age
after age, it is the people of India who have risen against the social and
cultural domination of the upper classes often masquerading as castes, and in
course of their own socio-cultural evolution caused the conflicts within the
body-politic to be resolved. So it was in the Buddhist revolution, the
Vaishnavite upsurge, and similar movements of life and thought. No doubt always
orthodox society leaning on classical thought staged a reaction. But in the process
it absorbed as best as it could what it sought to defeat. So it was with the
Hindu revival after the defeat of Buddhism. The synthetic core of Indian life
and culture was preserved. Today however it is no longer society and culture
apart. Today life is socio-centred to<i> </i>the extent that its betterment is
not possible without collective action. Collective action means political
action. It cannot be said as yet what methods the people will choose. For,
ultimately the people will choose, not the parties. The people will choose also
in Pakistan. The quest for freedom there will transcend the
religio-national–which means the communal–setting. For, not within communal
bounds can the values of art and science in this twentieth century be attained.
Therefore men’s and women’s spirits are today starved in Pakistan. For contacts
outside, if only through books, they feel a spiritual hunger. Everything is
being done to stifle such contacts, and the extension of the passport system to
travel between East Bengal and India is the latest of such measures. Already
its dialectical result is a greater yearning for continuance of cultural union
between the two Bengals. Already it is being asked in West Bengal why East
Bengal’s links with West are being forcibly sundered. A psychological
orientation of the minds of the people of East Bengal for total alienation from
West Bengal will of course be attempted. That will be no expansion of freedom,
and Pakistan was conceived in a spirit of freedom from caste Hindu domination.
The clock of history cannot be put back in Pakistan any more than it can be put
back elsewhere. So there also the lives and thoughts of the people will work
out a path of expanding freedom. It is not to be expected that East
Bengal–which has made a bid for social freedom by abolishing landlordism and
the Permanent Settlement–and, for the matter of that, Pakistan will agree to be
shut out of modern currents of life and thought. In that case there is little
reason why she should not fall in line with India’s transition from medievalism
to modernism which is provenly under way. Maybe Pakistan will yet prove to be
one of the movements of Indian history by which a synthesis of the country’s
heterogeneous element has through conflict and revolt, been attained. The movement
for Pakistan had the elemental support of the Muslim masses of India and all
the elements of a popular movement. Pakistan today is an anti-thesis of all
that India stands for. This relation Pakistan to India has the formal effect of
challenging India’s secularism. That challenge is represented by Hindu
chauvinism which is, paradoxically enough, on common ground with Pakistan
regarding complete separate identities of Hindus and Muslims. Dialectically,
however, the challenge has the effect of chastening and strengthening
secularism. On that strength the secular democracy of India withstands Hindu
communalism as well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

maintenance of secularism in India in word and deed will act as a
historical-scientific force for the reclamation of Pakistan from the communal
nationalism which has, in spite of certain immediate material advantages,
landed her in moral and spiritual frustration. Counter-communalism–and that
also in the name of nationalism–ill-conceived out of supposed retaliation
against Pakistan can only retard that process. Ostensibly a formal reaction
against Pakistan, it is really a reaction against the dialectical evolution of
Pakistan out of the contradiction in which its genesis has placed it in
relation to the requirements of progress. Every Indian, owes it to his own
country to strengthen its secularism by observing it scrupulously in his
individual sphere. Else he betrays ignorance of the trend of forces at work in
Pakistan and lack of faith in his own country.</span><span style='font-size:

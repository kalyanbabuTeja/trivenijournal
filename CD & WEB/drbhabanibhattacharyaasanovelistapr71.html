<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Bhabani Bhattacharya is
an outstanding Indo-Anglian novelist of the present times. He has attained
world-wide renown and his books have appeared in twenty-six languages, sixteen
of which are European. He has won the coveted Sahitya Akademy Award for 1967
for his latest novel ‘Shadow from Ladakh’ which is a deserving and deserved
honour done to the genius of Dr. Bhattacharya. Speaking of the award, he remarks:
“It is good to be known abroad. Even so, I must confess that I would like to be
known to my countrymen too. The award redresses a balance. So far I have been
better known in the U. S. and Europe than in my own country.” It is a pity that
Indians recognise the worth of Indian writers only after due recognition from
the West. It has been our tradition to recognise talent only after it is
vociferously applauded in other countries. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All the novels of
Bhattacharya present a true picture of India and its teeming millions surging
with life and substance. He does not believe in the dictum of art for art’s
sake. All writing for him has a social purpose. His outlook is highly
constructive and purposeful. Smt. Lila Ray writes, “As we read his writing, we
hear the dialogue between man and his situation, between man and man and
between man and the ideas he lives by.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It is a strange
coincidence to be a Bengali, born in Bhagalpur, a town in Bihar, writing in an
alien language and living in Maharashtra (‘Godhuli’, Nagpur). He is a doctorate
from London University on historical research. He has worked for several years
as press attache to the Indian Embassy in Washington. Writing is his first love
and full-time career. He has been inspired in his literary pursuits by his wife,
Salila, who is herself a short-story writer. He has recently joined the
research centre of the University of Hawaii. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His works include
Tagore’s translations entitled “The Golden Boat”, “Indian Cavalcade”, a
collection of historical sketches, “Towards Universal Man” a commemoration
volume published on the eve of the birth centenary of Tagore, “Steel-Hawk” a
collection of fifteen short stories, ‘Gandhi, the writer: His image as it
grew’, a highly stimulating and provocative study released on the occasion of
the birth centenary of Mahatma Gandhi and five novels–“So Many Hungers” (1947),
“Music for Mohini” (1952), “He who rides a Tiger” (1954), “A Goddess named
Gold” (1960) and “Shadow from Ladakh” (1967). He is at present working on
another political subject–the impact of China over Asia. It will be more or
less a continuation of his ‘Shadow from Ladakh’ in theme and treatment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His wide range of
experience in and around the world and his close association with men, manners
and their personalities have enabled him to grasp the innate significance of
humanity and all this finds expression in the characters of his novels and
short-stories, carved out with a pen that never wavers. The reader lives with
the characters of the stories and marvel at the author’s keen observation of
the day-to-day incidents of life. Bhattacharya has written with a spicy
language which is at once crisp and facile. He has caught the vein of rural
speech and the informal behaviour of the people, their rustic world and their
small and simple views about the great things that take place around them. He
holds the view that “Indian writing in English has been a decisive factor in
redressing the balance of false presentation by foreign story-tellers who with
their limited possibilities of true experience have seen only the surface of
our way of life, failing to reach deeper into our spirit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His earlier novels have
their roots in rural Vidarbha. He remains an unequalled master in interpreting
rural India. Particularly in the novel ‘A Goddess named Gold’ the worlds of
fable and reality that delve deep in the minds of our rural folk are skilfully
and artistically blended. It contains, like his other novel ‘He who rides a
Tiger’, some superb descriptions of rural folk. Sudhakar Joshi feels, “His
novels have a penetrating and sympathetic analysis of the simple but
unsurmountable problems in Indian life. His themes generally revolve round
poverty, hunger, pestilence, traditionalism, caste, India’s struggle against
poverty, industrialisation and the resulting controversy of Gandhian panacea <i>versus
</i>rapid industrialisation.” In an interview with Joshi, Bhattacharya replies,
“Most of my characters have shaped themselves from the real earth. The end of
the story in my case is never the one in which I had in my mind in the
beginning. Even the original plan itself gets modified due to certain traits
which my characters develop during the course of events.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>L. N. Gupta writes:
“Pure intellectuals watch the crowds but do not force themselves on them. They visit
slums and absorb the misery of their dwellers in their being. They tour the
famine-stricken areas. They look into the shrivelled faces and sunken eyes of
the sufferer. They share their distress. But they do not use amplifiers to
blare their benefaction. They suffer quietly. The process involves a cycle of
seething tensions. The end product is a major work, say a great novel in the
case of a fiction writer. It is a monument to its times. Such is the case with
Bhabani Bhattacharya.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dr. C. Paul Verghese
rightly remarks that “Food is the primary requisite of human dignity; hunger
debases and dehumanises man. That is why hunger is the theme of a large number
of Indo-Anglian novels. Bhattacharya has dealt quite forcefully with the theme
of hunger and the concomitant theme of human degradation in his novels ‘So Many
Hungers’ and ‘He who rides a Tiger.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The Bengali famine which
had so devastatingly swept his own province, Bengal, in 1943, was the
background to his first novel ‘So Many Hungers’. He was so profoundly moved by
the famine that he wrote it piecing the story together from newspaper
clippings. It was published in 1947 and became a best-seller in various
translations. L.N. Gupta states, “It was a terrible indictment of the British
Raj for all their crimes which aggregated into the disastrous famine of Bengal
in 1943.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It was a man-made famine
that took a toll of two million innocent men, women and children. The story
centres round the Basu family, the peasant family, the girl Kajoli, her mother
and her brother. Samarendra Basu thinks of organising the concern Bengal Rice
Limited and the unscrupulous Sir Lakshminath helps the company extend its
branches to every far off corner of the province. It is this man’s genius that
has so well spread the grease of corruption and stored the accumulated
foodgrains. The wells of pity seem to have almost dried up and only the jackals
and the vultures have been vigorous and jubilant. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Bhattacharya paints the
naked horror of it all with a pitiless precision and cumulative detail. Dr.
Srinivasa Iyengar states, <i>“So many Hungers </i>is no doubt an impeachment of
man’s inhumanity to man, but it is also a dramatic study of a set of human
beings caught in a unique and tragic predicament.” The story has been
effectively told and the tragic pathos of the real mass-starvation described in
the guise of fiction moves the reader deeply. The novel describes, as the
“Times Literary Supplement” puts it, “a factual and vivid account of one of the
most shocking disasters in history.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“His second novel,
‘Music for Mohini’, deals with caste distinctions and poverty. L. N. Gupta
remarks, ‘Music for Mohini’ blows up the citadel of old traditions and
superstitions which menace India’s progress.” Reviewing this novel, <i>The New
York Times </i>observed, ‘It blends the story of an attractive girl’s marriage
with the eternal problems of that caste-ridden land and its divorcement from
various kinds of imperial rule. And the main brick-bats are not hurled at
Britain.’ <i>The Chicago Tribune </i>showered its praise on this novel by
stating that “India as presented by Rudyard Kipling, Rabindranath Tagore and
others has become to us a multiple image. Now these diverse pictures are
brought into focus by a native son. In a splendid novel that may rank with
Pearl Buck’s ‘The Good Earth’, Bhabani Bhattacharya gives us modern India.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In this novel, a young
girl of seventeen is married in the traditional manner after observing the
auspicious signs and comparing the horoscopes. Mohini goes to her new home.
Jayadev the quiet scholar who lives in his ancestral village, and Mohini, the
young city-bred wife of his, adapts herself very well to her new environment,
are the two forces that put the village on the path of progress and
modernisation. The superstitious old mother of Jayadev realises in the end her
mistake and reconciles herself to the changing times. The characters of Mohini
and Jayadev and Heeralal are well drawn with sculpturesque precision and facile
expression. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The third novel ‘He who
rides a Tiger’ is an attack on both who profited on people’s misery during the
famine and those who exploited them as caste tyrants. It is a legend of
freedom, a legend to inspire and awaken. Here he discusses a variation on the
theme of hunger. It has a fascinating beginning. The story runs rapidly surging
with emotion and agitation. Its sharp and vivid characterisation and untainted
realism make this novel a very interesting one. It is a grim satire on Hindu
orthodoxy. Dr. Iyengar says, “The tempo of life in Calcutta–the complex of
urban vices and urban sophistication, the pressure of mass movements and mass
hysteria, the reign of superstition and mumbo jumbo–gives the novel an entire
and piquant quality all its own.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This novel is based on
an ancient saying “He who rides a tiger cannot dismount.” A humble village
blacksmith, named Kalo takes his revenge on a rigid, caste-ridden society and
makes a living for himself and his daughter by faking a miracle–a miracle that
begins as a fraud and ends as a legend–and passing himself off as a Brahmin
priest. The story ends with a note of triumph for the soul over flesh.
Eventually when the fraud is detected, other low caste people hail him as their
brother and the outraged upholders of caste and custom panic. Reviewing this
novel, Orville Prescott of <i>The New York Times </i>says, “He who rides a
tiger is a skilful and entertaining and an illuminating fictional glimpse
inside the corner of India. Bhattacharya writes of Indians and the social,
cultural and religious world in which they live with an authority and
understanding that no Western writer can hope to match.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His fourth novel, ‘A
Goddess named Gold’ is the best novel on Indian village life and makes a most
illuminating and satisfying reading experience. It is a masterly satire on
those who live by the lure of gold. It tells how high spiritual values like
spontaneous kindness are sought to be prostituted for purposes of gold. It is a
modern fable of rural India and the close textured fabric of its life on the
eve of Independence in 1947. The characters are introduced one by one in a
leisurely manner and we see among them a pretty girl, a strolling minstrel and
a magic talisman. Dr. Iyengar states, “It entertains as a story, but it also
disturbs us as a warning and as a prophecy.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

wandering minstrel, gives her an amulet and tells her that it will acquire the
power to turn the base metals into gold, if she does an act of real kindness.
She rescues a child. Seth Samsunderji seeks to profit out of India’s new-found
freedom and enters into a business deal with Meera on a fifty-fifty basis.
Meera gets disgusted with it finally and throws the amulet into the river. The
minstrel returns soon and explains that freedom is the real touchstone. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Bhattacharya’s latest
novel ‘Shadow from Ladakh’ tells an extremely gripping story of unsurpassed
drama on a broad and revealing canvas. It tells what India needs for survival–a
meeting point between Gandhian social ethics and tremendous forces of science
and technology. It deals with India’s conflict with China and her response to
the challenge. The theme presents a considerable amount of truth of a
politically conscious Indian family. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

into the contrasting contemporary life of India symbolised by Satyajit who regards
Indian village life as the ideal life and by the westernized American trained
Bhaskar, the forward-looking Chief Engineer in a steel plant, who feels India’s
future lies in industrialisation, ends on a weak note of coexistence of these
two ideologies. Bhaskar wants to dispossess Gandhigram, because it is a
hindrance to India’s industrialisation. He brings every pressure to bear, but
to his surprise, the community of the believers in non-violence stands firm
under its great leader Satyajit, and he himself falls in love with Satyajit’s
daughter, Sunita, a bare-foot white-saried girl...” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We can end with what Dr.
C. Paul Verghese rightly feels–“Bhattacharya has the vision of a welfare
society at heart. His concerns are clear and unambiguous; they are political,
economic and social. In other words, the dignity of man both in national and
international contexts is uppermost in his mind. In this he follows the
tradition of European social realism as does Mulk Raj Anand. For him art is
always the communication of certain social and political ideals and the
artistic form, the means of winning over his readers to his views. But the lack
of depth in his treatment of problems in human relations is a weakness of his
art.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

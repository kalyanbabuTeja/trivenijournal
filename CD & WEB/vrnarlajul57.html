style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
any community the editor of a daily newspaper is always a person of great
importance. But editors are of different kinds–some become editors by acquiring
financial control of the journal, others obtain the office by inheritance or
marriage. Such men are not content with calling themselves mere editors. They
are invariably Managing Editors, after the style familiarised by the great
Northcliffe. But editors, other than Managing Editors, are almost invariably
journalists who have worked their way up, often from the lowest rung in the
ladder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Perhaps
it is somewhat curious that Narla should be the editor of a Telugu journal,
since he was born in Jabalpur, on the banks of the Narmada, brought up in
Saugar till his seventh year in the long and deep shadows of the Vindhyas' as
he likes to put it, and knew no Telugu whatsoever in the earliest years of his
life. It was only the complete loss of all the family fortune that brought his
parents back to their native village Kauthavaram in the Krishna District. He
moved rapidly through a formal education at a private middle school in
Kauthavaram, high schools in Gudivada and Guntur and colleges at Kakinada and
Masulipatam.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Narla
took to journalism even in his college days. His first contribution appeared in
the <i>Congress, </i>a radical weekly, edited by Sri Madduri Annapurnayya who
was later closely associated with Subhas Chandra Bose and his Forward Bloc.
While still a student in the Noble College, Masulipatam, Narla started working
as part-time sub-editor of the <i>Krishna Patrika, </i>writing occasionally to
Dr. Pattabhi’s <i>Janmabhumi, </i>the <i>People </i>of Lahore and the <i>Maharatta
</i>of Poona. In fact he paid his way through college by his free-lance
journalism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was inevitable that Narla should make journalism his career. But in his youth
he was very much moved by the social and political conditions of his time. Even
when he was attending the private middle school in Kauthavaram he came under
the influence of the Brahmo Samaj, which a decade or two earlier had played
such an important part in the cause of social justice in Andhra. But this great
movement had gradually lost its hold on Andhra, as well as in Bengal, and some
of its followers drifted into other fields, mainly political. Narla in his
early years at college was just ripe for the political movement. At the time of
the Salt Satyagraha, into which he plunged most recklessly, he was beaten up
brutally by the Malabar police who were specially posted in East Krishna where
this movement was gaining momentum every day. The occasion for this brutal
treatment was, interestingly enough, the discovery, during a raid on his home,
of an article which was ready to<i> </i>be posted to <i>Janmabhumi. </i>Enraged
by the language of this article, the European Dy. S. P. ordered the immediate
removal of Narla to the outskirts of the village for the purpose of setting an
unforgettable example. The beating was so severe that he lost consciousness and
it was almost by a miracle that he escaped death.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
East Krishna District Congress Committee, in the false hope of stemming the
wave of police terrorism, appealed to Narla through the Editor of the <i>Krishna
Patrika </i>and induced him to file a civil suit for damages against the police
officers that were responsible for the violent attack on his person. The police
in their turn arrested him on a trumped-up charge of picketing an arrack shop
and succeeded in getting him sentenced to a term of six months’ hard labour. He
appealed and was released on bail. Meanwhile the Gandhi-Irwin Pact was signed
and the case against him was dropped. Narla also was persuaded to withdraw his
suit against the police.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>While
he had forgiven the police for their brutal attack on his person, he could not
reconcile himself to the political situation that followed the Gandhi-Irwin
Pact. Driven by a violent sense of righteous anger against foreign misrule and
a deep feeling of frustration under Congress leadership, he joined a terrorist
group and was actively engaged for some time in collecting illicit fire arms. Narla
however did not have the mental make-up of a terrorist. Owing to certain
differences in policy with an active member of the group, Narla withdrew from
the terrorist movement just in time to escape being one of the principal
accused in the Madras Conspiracy Case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On
the eve of the introduction of the new Constitution which was soon to whirl the
Congress into political power in the various provinces of India, Narla,
characteristically, decided to quit active politics and take to journalism as a
profession. Arriving in Madras, with less than two rupees in his pocket,
looking out for a job, he had the good fortune to meet the veteran journalist
Sri S. G. Acharya of the <i>Chitragupta </i>and <i>Praja Bandhu </i>who
befriended him. But during the first few months of his stay in Madras, he could
only make a precarious living from his frequent contributions to the Telugu
press. He saw little future for the Telugu journals of that era. The colossal
success of the <i>Hindu </i>and the rapid rise of the <i>Indian Express, </i>attracted
him to the English journals, but he could get no footing in either. The only
experience he was able to get was as an unpaid apprentice on the <i>Justice, </i>the
organ of a decaying party bolstered up by decadent Zamindars. Even this
incongruous attachment ceased within a month. Alarmed by police reports that
Narla was a dangerous terrorist, the Editor sacked the unpaid apprentice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Some
months afterwards, Narla got on to the <i>Swarajya </i>as city reporter on the
magnificent salary of Rs. 25 per month with an allowance of Rs. 5 for a tram
pass. Like many of the young men who had starved along with their wives and
children to keep the <i>Swarajya </i>going under the idealistic, but thoroughly
unbusiness-like, management of the Andhra-Kesari, Narla is invariably silent
when questioned about the cash he had actually received from the <i>Swarajya. </i>His
experience on the <i>Swarajya, </i>however, was invaluable though he had served
only eight months on this journal. Rapidly shifted from reporting to
proof-reading, from there to sub-editing, and ultimately to the desk of the
sole night-editor, even of a journal which was on the verge of extinction, he
had a training which was to stand him in good stead in later life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Driven
by the necessity to eke out a livelihood, however small, Narla moved from one
impoverished journal to another, ranging from the news-editorship of the <i>Janavani,
</i>to the Editor- ship-in-charge of the <i>Prajamitra, </i>till he ultimately
reached the <i>Andhra Prabha, </i>as its news-editor, on August 1, 1938, a
fortnight before its birth. In 1942 he became the Editor of this Journal and
rapidly built it up into the largest circulated Telugu daily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Under
the imaginative editorship of Narla, the <i>Prabha, </i>more than any other
Journal, has played an important part in shaping public opinion in Andhra. At
the time of the formation of the Andhra State, Narla pleaded for the location
of the capital at Guntur. He did not succeed. But the men who persisted in
dragging the cumbersome machinery of the newly-formed State to out-of-the-way
Kurnool were soon to realise the mistake they had committed, a mistake which
has cost this deficit State some crores of wasteful expenditure. The temporary
location of the High Court at Guntur was perhaps an accident, dependent on the
whims of the leader of an insignificant political party. But the atmosphere was
created by the <i>Prabha </i>to locate it in that ever-growing city which
alone, of all the cities in Andhra, could undertake the responsibility. And the
formation of Visalandhra was to some extent the result of persistent hammering
by the <i>Prabha. </i>But for its vigorous campaign the ugly name of
‘Andhra-Telangana’ would have been foisted on it. It was <i>Prabha </i>again
that led the opposition to the Krishna-Pennar Project. For months it battled
against the scheme which sought to divert the waters of the Krishna to the
far-off South, leaving millions of acres of farm land on its very banks athirst
and arid. It may perhaps be mentioned in passing that it was <i>Prabha </i>which
first suggested that the new scheme which replaced the Krishna-Pennar be named
the Nagarjuna Sagar Project. Another claim of this Journal under the editorship
of Narla for the gratitude of Andhra is the public funds it collected to the
tune of more than Rs. 750,000 to give succour to the people that were hit by
natural calamities like famine and flood.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Honest
journalism is rare in any country. Many journals are swayed by party leanings;
their policies are shaped by business interests, sometimes even by the whims of
an individual. But Narla is always fearless in his criticism. Without becoming
attached to any of the groups which had been squabbling in the field of Andhra
politics during the last 15 years, he expressed his opinions in no uncertain
language. The Andhra Kesari, Gopala Reddi, Sanjiva Reddi and Acharya Ranga have
all had their share of severe criticism bordering on censure from this fearless
journalist. He has built up for the <i>Prabha </i>a reputation worthy of the <i>Manchester
Guardian.<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
it is as a writer that Narla is better known to the intellectuals of Andhra.
His numerous publications stand testimony to the literary talents of this
versatile writer. His first book, <i>Swadesa Samstanalu, </i>dealing with the
Indian States, was published while he was still in college. It was received
very favourably by the press. A review of the book in glowing terms by Sri
Mutnuri Krishna Rao was published as a first leader in the <i>Krishna Patrika. </i>A
thousand copies were sold within three months of publication, quite a record at
the time for a first book by an unknown author. His second venture in
authorship, <i>Neti Russia, </i>which was perhaps the very first book in Telugu
on Soviet Russia, was written while he was still a student and was published
soon after he passed his B. A. examination in 1934. It was banned almost
immediately after publication by the Madras, Hyderabad and Mysore Govern</span><span

<i>Kotta Gadda, </i>a collection of sixteen One-Act Plays, is </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>now
in its second edition. He is the first playwright in Andhra whose One-Act Plays
were presented to the public by a professional troupe. Many of them are being
enacted in almost every town, and in a large number of villages, in Andhra.
Some of his plays were produced by me for the Andhra University Experimental
Theatre and one of them <i>Prarabdham </i>was included in a collection of
One-Act Plays edited by me and recently published.<sup>1 </sup>His One-Act
Plays have contributed considerably to experimental drama in Andhra, and his
volume of plays is acknowledged as an outstanding contribution to modern Telugu
literature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

His other works include <i>Maata-Manti </i>and <i>Pitcha-Paati, </i>two
collections of essays, and <i>Kadambam, </i>a literary miscellany. Besides
these works of literary standing, there are several other publications of his
on current politics. More than one of his books had been banned by provincial

writings were translated into Hindi, Tamil and Kannada.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

had come into first contact with his work in 1936 through his Telugu
translation of a <i>Tchehov’s </i>story, <i>Chorus Girl. </i>As my wife and I
had translated the same story and published it eight years earlier, I was
interested to note that he was completely ignorant of the earlier translation.
I have had occasion to admire his work as news-editor of the <i>Janavani, </i>the
short-lived journal to which I was contributing weekly political notes. The
work of Narla as news-editor of the <i>Andhra Prabha </i>was very interesting.
New words were appearing every day during the tension of the Second World War.
Translations were difficult, and archaic Sanskrit equivalents, previously so
common in Telugu, were found to be inadequate. Everyone looked to the <i>Andhra
Prabha </i>for newly-coined words which expressed the meaning and were easily
understood by the man in the street. At that time I was doing broadcasts for
the A. I. R., Madras, in refuting enemy propaganda, and found the terminology
of the <i>Prabha </i>quite adequate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

had not met, in spite of several common interests we had, in all the years I
had lived in Madras. It was only years later, when Narla visited the Andhra
University at Waltair to deliver an address to the students, that I first met
him. During his brief stay with us we talked of Konark which he was about to
visit. I found that he was very well-informed, and that he was quite different
from the charlatans who are only too ready to prattle on art. During the years
that followed, I was to come into closer contact with him in various cultural
activities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

a man becomes successful in life, symbols of success surround him. Some
successful men buy luxurious automobiles, build flamboyant houses and dress
themselves expensively–not so Narla. He has neither a car nor a house of his

since <i>Vandemalaram </i>days. He lives simply with his family in Royapettah
in an essentially domestic setting in a first-floor flat. A few feet away from this
apartment he does his work in another first-floor flat in a different building.
I found both the apartments filled with exquisite treasures which only a

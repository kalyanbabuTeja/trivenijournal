were brothers. Brahmananda had been a scholarly preacher. The Ahom kings had
granted him considerable land. Brahmananda died but in time the Gosain family
of Anandapur came to be quite rich and influential. “The tiger and the deer
drank in the same tank”, as it is said, so powerful they became. Possessing men
and women, land and property, they lived like zamindars. The Gosain used to

the morning of Ambubasi in the month of Ahara, Sadananda’s son Devananda
crawled up the tree to have a fruit. Sraddhananda’s son came out rushing and
pulled the other by the foot. Devananda fell down like a severed pumpkin.
Sadananda who witnessed the whole affair rushed in like a hawk and shouted down
the place. “Does one slay a man for a paltry jack-fruit? I will see whose
father planted this tree!” he cried, and slapped Sraddhananda’s son Vidyananda
hard. Then he picked some jack-fruits and went home taking his son by hand.
Sraddhananda was not at home at the time, else matters would have gone to the
limit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Sraddhananda came home his wife and son started lamenting and gesticulating.
His wife wailed, “My child had touched his feet and appealed to him not to
pluck the green fruits. Can you lay it down as a fault? Should he be beaten

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Sraddhananda was infuriated. He began to address
Sadananda with those obscene words which a dictionary-maker keeps out of his
work. Sadananda came out with his wife and children. Sraddhananda’s wife and
son also took their stand behind their liege-lord. There ensued a passage of
words. “I will make you vomit jack-fruits, I will,” Sraddhananda gesticulated.
Indeed he filed a case against his brother and nephew for having stolen his
jack-fruits. Both were summoned to the court. Sraddhananda grinned
self-complacently, “Let father and son now go and press oil.”</p>

the first day of the trial, the accused persons had to stand in the dock.

such a competitive spirit did the parties enter into litigation. Able lawyers
were engaged. The magistrate advised, “Come to a settlement.” But who would
listen to whom? Sraddhananda had his land measured by a Mandal. Sadananda also
engaged a Mandal to measure his land–the tree fell to his lot. Sraddhananda
hired witnesses, the other won them over by paying higher fees. Scores of
rupees were spent. Day passed after day, week after week. Fees to pleaders and
petition-writers exhausted them. After an interval of seven months the case was
taken up. Witnesses were examined and affidavits taken. Some voted for
Sraddhananda while the others for Sadananda. One Mandal said the tree belonged
to Sraddhananda, a second said it belonged to Sadananda. At last the case was
argued by the pleaders. The pleader belonging to the party of the complainant
said: “The tree and its fruits belong to him in whose land it has its trunk,
for the tree is living on sustenance sucked from the land belonging to the
complainant. The fruits are but the transformation of the sap of his land.
Because the two accused have carried off the fruits without the permission of
the complainant, they are guilty of committing theft.” The pleader of the
accused laughed away the argument. He said: “Where is the evidence that the
trunk of the tree is within the jurisdiction of Sraddhananda? One Mandal gives
one version, the other a second one. Even if it is assumed that the trunk
belongs to the complainant, it cannot be said that the fruits belong to him.
The air above a piece of land may be claimed by the owner of that land. Now,
this particular tree draws with its leaves nitrogen from the air belonging to
the accused, just as it draws with its roots juice from the soil of the
complainants. So the fruits are not the transformation of the sustenance drawn
from the soil of the complainant only, but the transformation of the accused’s
air also. Especially as the fruits and leaves are hanging in air belonging to
the accused, they belong to the latter, and as such, a complaint of theft
cannot arise here.” The complainant’s party produced a ruling of the Patna High
Court, and the aceused’s party a ruling laid down by the Bombay High Court. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

days after, the magistrate gave his verdict. Setting aside the rulings of the
Patna and Bombay High Courts he wrote: “It is a quarrel between two brothers,
on succession matters, at most on boundary differences. It cannot be determined
to whose share the tree will go.” He allowed the complainant to bring a civil
suit and acquitted </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Sraddhananda the verdict was a bolt from the blue. It was too much ado about
nothing. After having spent four to five hundred rupees it turned out thus. The
pleader put the blame on the magistrate, the petition-writer on the witnesses,
the witnesses on one another. Sadananda’s people on the other hand were making
merry. To which ever quarter Sraddhananda turned, he was laughed at by the
people of the other side and reminded of the jack-fruits. In grief and
mortification he came back home as one dead. In Sadananda’s house people
gathered and laughed and sang, took tea and sweets and prattled. “Well, not
that a jack-fruit is a valuable thing. But it is a point of prestige,
self-respect. Supposing our Junior Gosain had lost the case, could he have
shown his nose about? Our Senior Gosain, on the other side, is lying quiet like
a stoned dove. A good lesson indeed, a good lesson, that he has learnt today.
Yes, in you is Brahmananda’s blood, in you only”–meaning Gosain Junior. All
this pierced the ear of Sraddhananda. He started shaking in anger.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

so much noise and merry-making, Sraddhananda’s five-year old daughter went to
see what was happening there. Sadananda’s son covered her head with the refuse
of a jack-fruit and said, “Go, let your father have them.” The girl, with her
head all spoilt by the adhesive juice of the peeling, wailed back to her
father. Sraddhananda could take it no further. He picked up an axe, went out
and started striking at the jack-fruit tree. Seeing this Sadananda rushed out
with blazing eyes. The two started flinging invectives at each other and pulled
at the axe. Bidyananda came to the scene and struck on Sadananda’s head with a
stick. The wounded man, with his top bleeding, snatched away the axe and gave a
blow upon Bidyananda’s head. The axe entered the skull and the boy fell down
like a severed plantain tree. In a moment all the noise and merry-making was
silenced by this terrible bloodshed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

began to shake. He became wild with anger and grief. He cursed and cried. His
wrath against the murderer of his son grew in proportion to the realization of
his sorrow. It was a burning hatred, which knew not a moment’s rest, not a
shade of forgiveness. Day and night loomed before his eyes the dead body of his
Bidynanda, that blow on the head, the torrent of blood. Unremittingly he
remembered the terrific image of Sadananda, and the latter’s axe cracking his
son’s skull. He found it impossible to restrain himself. He felt like piercing
his brother’s throat with his teeth and suck blood. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
sensational case of man-slaughter started. Both the sides were egged on by an
inhuman hatred. One tried to save the murderer, the other to have the life of
the latter. Truth and falsehood could not be distinguished one from another.
Things were repeated. If one party procured witnesses by paying them, they were
won over by the other party. At last the accused was found ‘not guilty’–on the
benefit of the doubt. When he learnt the verdict of the court, Sraddhananda
cried out: “Then do you say that my son was killed by the air? He snatched the
axe from my hand and cracked my son’s skull, do you question even that?” He
stepped on to a juror and demanded, “Do you have any doubt regarding the truth
that you are alive and kicking and my son is dead?” The juror ran away. Like a
maniac Sraddhananda showered obscenities on the court, the law, the jury and
the pleaders. Sadananda again laughed for joy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

wailed and heaped curses on his brother. At last the retired Mandal of the
village, Cheniram Thakuria, happened to be at his place. He spoke words of
solace, told him of fate, of the writing on one’s forehead, spoke of the Gita
and the Bhagavata, the tales of Yudhishthira and Rama, and also discoursed on
“The Brahman is Truth, world is false”. Last of all he suggested, “Reverend
Sir, if you wish at all for revenge, then you may start a civil suit as the
magistrate had advised, in order to prove that the tree belongs to you. I hear
the Sessions case compelled the Junior Gosain to mortgage his land to Jay
Narayan. If you can now get him into another he would have to sell all his
belongings.” Sraddhananda jumped at the suggestion, his eyes lit up with hope.
It was as if Indra got the bone of Dadhichi, to slay Britrasur. “I shall
exterminate him root and branch. I will reduce him to such a state that the
villagers would refuse him food.” To a Brahmana, saying means doing.. The very

he is going to exterminate! Let’s see who has more fire in his hand,” thundered
Sadananda. The question cropped up again: whose jack-fruit tree it was. As
before, both the parties entered the legal arena, again they procured witnesses
and won them over by bribing, again there was calling of bad names and
showering of curses. A civil suit and the glance of Saturn have the same import.
At the end of a year and a half, the Civil Judge gave his verdict: “They are
brothers and have not separated at all; they cook their meal on the same
hearth. The jack-fruit tree therefore belongs to both.” Sraddhananda’s case was
dismissed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

disallowed the appeal. He just corroborated the Civil Judge’s verdict,

Why should he care? It was joint property. The court had determined that.
Sraddhananda came out with a piece of bamboo. Devananda snatched it away, and
tied the old man to the tree. He sucked a mango and pushed the stone into the
old man’s mouth. Have it, my man, have it. Let us enjoy our joint property. Let
me have the kernel and yourself the shell.” Sraddhananda felt like tearing at

years have passed since then. Mr. Bikash Bharali, who belongs to my parts, is
an advocate of the Calcutta High Court. He has returned home after a year and a
half at the news of his mother’s death. At noon both of us were passing the
local Court. We saw a man with a heap of papers on his shoulder. He was
murmuring to himself and picking up any scrap of paper that could be seen. When
we came near hear him he cried out–“Ho, ho, ho.” Mr. Bharali was startled much
as to move back a few steps. The man confronted us and murmured, “I shall
exterminate him, the cur. See, I have all the necessary copies.” He started
pulling at the sheaves of paper and mouthing obscenities. I knew how to quieten
him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

years rolled away and the litigation came to an end with a verdict in favour of
Sraddhananda. By the time Sraddhananda came to know that he had won, he was a raving
maniac with only one <i>mantra </i>on his lips; “I shall exterminate him, the
cur! I shall...” All his property was lost to Jay Narayan and the bone of
contention–the jack-fruit tree–was cut down by the Matwari to build his
oil-mill,–that too on the hallowed plinth of the great Brahmananda Gosain of
Anandapur, the scholar and landlord who had been so kindly treated by the Assam
Kings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

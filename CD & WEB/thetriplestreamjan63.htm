Swami Vivekananda occupies an exalted position. Born at a time when the country
was completely under the sway of an alien culture and her basic ideals were
being challenged, the Swami strove from early youth to meet that challenge.
Earlier than Sri Aurobindo and Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore and Dr
Radhakrishnan, he made <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
aware of her spiritual heritage and enabled her to regain confidence in herself
and her destiny as the upholder of eternal values. His Master, Sri Ramakrishna,
had achieved in his inmost consciousness a synthesis of the many modes of the
quest for the Divine and presented the final phase of that quest as the
identity of the individual soul with the Supreme. The message of the Vedanta
was for all humanity, irrespective of country or creed, and Vivekananda made it
his life’s mission to convey that message on behalf of his Master. He was
devoted to Hinduism and the Hindu way of life, but his Hinduism was no narrow
creed but a faith alive and vibrant, a flame that could purify and ennoble
humanity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Swami was moved by the sight of the poverty-stricken masses of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, hungry
and ill-clad. But they were gods in the making and he felt his kinship with
them. The humanitarian work of the Ramakrishna Mission in its early stages was
the outcome of the Swami’s longing to bring <span class=SpellE>succour</span>
to the distressed and the down-trodden. In his view this work was as important
as the spreading of the Master’s gospel of the <span class=SpellE>divinasation</span>
of man through individual effort aided by the loving guidance of the seniors
who had learnt earlier to tread the path of holiness. The material prosperity
of the Motherland was, however, to be achieved without detriment to her
spiritual elevation. <st1:country-region w:st="on">America</st1:country-region>,
<st1:country-region w:st="on">Japan</st1:country-region> and other countries
were prosperous, but he was not anxious to make <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> a mere copy of them. There
was to be perfect accord between body, mind and spirit; and any sign of
weakness in any one of these would be fatal to the harmonious development of
the individual and the race. Health of body, alertness of mind and utter purity
of spirit were necessary, and the hope for humanity lay in the emergence of
disciplined individuals devoted to unselfish service and the fearless pursuit
of the higher life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Krishna Sastri and Viswanatha, and of many others who loved him for his innate
nobility and tenderness, and admired him for the excellence of his poetry.
Venkateswara Rao was singularly free from any trace of personal ambition. He
never sought recognition, but was happy when recognition came to him. He was serene
and detached, yet full of the joy of life. He was fond of company and spread
sunshine in all assemblies, but he could be alone with his thoughts and his <span

Sastri at <span class=SpellE>Masulipatam</span>, Venkateswara Rao and <span
class=SpellE>Pingali</span> <span class=SpellE>Lakshmikantam</span> were drawn
to each other, and they became ‘twin-poets’ like <span class=SpellE>Venkata</span>
Sastri and Tirupati Sastri of the earlier generation. Early in their literary
career, they published a collection of poems, <span class=SpellE><i>Tholakari</i></span>
(early showers), to which Sri C. <span class=SpellE>Ramalinga</span> Reddy
contributed an appreciative foreword. The poems brought fame to the young
poets, and the personal affection of lovers of literature. The verse was of
high quality, chaste and limpid, and the themes related to the rural life of
Andhra–the fields and pastures, and the festive scenes at the season of <span
class=SpellE>Sankranti</span> when the harvest is gathered. In 1933, when <span
class=SpellE>Lakshmikantam</span> was Head of the Telugu Department at the <st1:place

they published the <span class=SpellE>Soundaranandam</span> and dedicated it to
their Guru, <span class=SpellE>Venkata</span> Sastri. This <span class=SpellE>kavya</span>
is not a translation of <span class=SpellE>Asvaghosha’s</span> work, but an
independent one adopting the same theme. <span class=SpellE>Nanda</span> and
his wife Sundari are the ideal lovers and aesthetes, content to dwell in a
world of their own, where eternal <span class=GramE>Spring</span> reigns and
the flowers do not fade and the leaves do not fall. But the Buddha’s influence
finally transmutes their love for each other into compassion for all beings.
Its rich emotion and the exquisite phrasing and narrative skill won for this <span

literature. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

allegiance to Sri <span class=SpellE>Mutnuri</span> Krishna Rao, philosopher

Artists and poets, men of learning and men of affairs, gathered round Sri
Krishna Rao and profited by his discourses on Art and Philosophy. The ‘<span

and Venkateswara Rao was the Master of <span class=SpellE>Cermonies</span>. He
sprayed ‘rose-water’ in the shape of poems and literary essays enlivened by
gentle raillery and <span class=SpellE>humour</span>. Next to his Guru, <span
class=SpellE>Venkata</span> Sastri, Sri Krishna Rao influenced Venkateswara <span
class=SpellE>Rao’s</span> outlook on life and its problems. His poetry, in
later years, was mellowed by philosophy. By a strange chance, Venkateswara Rao
was Editor of the ‘<span class=SpellE>Patrika</span>’ after Sri Krishna Rae
passed away in 1946, and I was Co-Editor with him for a year. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

thirty years after <span class=SpellE><i>Soundaranandam</i></span><i> </i>Venkateswara
Rao wrote poems and essays, satires and <span class=SpellE>playlets</span>, and
translated important books from English and Sanskrit. His prose is as beautiful
as his verse, and his speeches as illuminating as his writings. Of his recent
poems, <span class=SpellE><i>Gudigantalu</i></span><i> </i>(<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType

and <span class=SpellE><i>Poulastya</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>Hridayam</span>
</i>(The Heart of Ravana) are the most admired. The latter presents Ravana as a
fervent devotee of Rama, longing to meet death at his hand and thus be restored
to his original status as door-keeper of Vishnu in <span class=SpellE>Vaikunta</span>.
His <span class=SpellE><i>Muvva</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>Gopala</span> </i>is
a radio-play relating to the life of the composer <span class=SpellE>Kshetragna</span>.
The Poet’s portrayal of <span class=SpellE>Kshetragna</span> as the embodiment
of ‘<span class=SpellE>Madhura</span> Bhakti’ is of abiding value. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

met him for the last time a month before he passed away, and spent two days by
his sick-bed. What memories crowded on us, and how we dwelt on the many
occasions when we were together! In 1954 he was present at the Silver Jubilee
of <i>Triveni </i>in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Bangalore</st1:place></st1:City>
and blessed me and my Journal. The leading writers in Kannada <span
class=SpellE>honoured</span> him at a special function. Whenever the 25th of
December came round, he would remember it was the birthday of <i>Triveni </i>and
invite me to spend the day with him and a select group of friends. It is
disheartening to think that it was also the day in 1962 when he was snatched
away by death. His affection for </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

watched over me and guided me through the intricate mazes of life. Without him,

a fortnight after that fateful 25th of December came the distressing news that <span
class=SpellE>Somasekhara</span> <span class=SpellE>Sarma</span>, the
distinguished research scholar and historian, was no more. During the last few
years, he was in the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Andhra</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, guiding
students in his <span class=SpellE>favourite</span> subjects–South Indian
History, archaeology, epigraphy and numismatics. <span class=SpellE>Sarma</span>,
who never went to any College, attained a position in the world of historical
research which men with Doctorates might envy. Trained in the ways of research
by the late K. V. <span class=SpellE>Lakshmana</span> Rao and working with him
on the Telugu <span class=SpellE>Encyclopaedia</span>, <span class=SpellE>Sarma</span>
gave himself wholly and devotedly to the cause of research. Inscriptions on
stone or on copper-plates, and coins and manuscripts, yielded to him their
treasures of meaning, and, with their help, he illumined many dark corners of
the history of <st1:place w:st="on">South India</st1:place>. And he loved
literature too. The classics in Telugu and Sanskrit appealed to him, and he
laid them under contribution to supplement the information gleaned from
inscriptions. The younger writers and scholars looked up to him for a word of
commendation, and it was always given with that wealth of affection which he
showered on those who had the privilege of his friendship. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

an essay or addressing an audience was to him what the drawing of a picture is
to a painter or the chiseling of a stone into beautiful shape is to a sculptor.
There was perfection and grace in all that he accomplished. It was the outward
expression of the inner harmony which pervaded his being. In addition to
hundreds of inscriptions which he edited and published, he wrote valuable books
on Andhra art and history, biographical sketches and radio-plays. He was the
chief compiler of the <span class=SpellE>Encyclopaedia</span> published by the
Telugu <span class=SpellE>Bhasha</span> <span class=SpellE>Samiti</span>. The
volume on Andhra History and Culture is a monument of his skill in editing the
vast material on band, and he personally contributed many important articles.
His <i>magnum opus </i>was the <i>History of the Reddy Kingdoms </i>covering
the history of Andhra after the <span class=SpellE>Kakatiyas</span> and before <span
class=SpellE>Vijayanagara</span>. This was written in English, and dealt with
all aspects of the life of the people, literary, artistic, and commercial. <i>A
Forgotten Chapter of Andhra History </i>sums up the achievement of <span
class=SpellE>Kapaya</span> <span class=SpellE>Nayaka</span>, a local chieftain
of coastal Andhra who beat back the Muslim invaders after the fall of <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Warangal</st1:place></st1:City> and established
the independence of the region for a period. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

him and me there was the closest friendship. We met forty years ago, when <span

at first sight; it was like the meeting of friends known through the ages.
Later, I founded <i>Triveni </i>and he edited <i>Bharati. </i>In 1927 and 1928
we lived in the same house in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City>,
and on the 25th of December 1927 when <i>Triveni </i>was inaugurated in the
presence of an informal gathering of friends, <span class=SpellE>Vlswanatha</span>
Satyanarayana dedicated his book of poems, <i>Andhra <span class=SpellE>Prasasti</span>,

mutual affection was never eclipsed and when I visited him at <span

A warm-hearted comrade, an excellent host, a wise <span class=SpellE>counsellor</span>,
and the friend of all and enemy of none, <span class=SpellE>Sarma</span> summed
up in himself the qualities of <span class=SpellE>Vidura</span> of the <i>Mahabharata,
</i>as Dr S. V. <span class=SpellE>Joga</span> Rao suggested. Life is like a
banquet from which the guests are rapidly departing. There are empty places

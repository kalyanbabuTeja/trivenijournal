<h1>To Protect Freedom</h1>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
leaders of the Opposition groups in the Indian Parliament questioned the wisdom
of continuing the procedure of preventive detention for another two years. The
ordinary process of the law ought to be enough, according to them, to enable
the Government of the day to deal with any difficult situation and maintain law
and order. Imprisonment without a judicial trial, they contend, cuts at the
root of democracy; it is opposed to the fundamental rights guaranteed to Indian
citizens by the Constitution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>While
these objections were advanced by all the Opposition groups, there was among
them a broad division into two sections, according to the motives that impelled
them to fight against the Bill. Leaders like Pandit Kunzru and Dr. S. P.
Mookherjee are genuine friends of freedom and democracy, anxious that the
rights of citizens should not be curtailed by ‘repressive’ laws. They found it
difficult to believe that erstwhile leaders of the freedom fight could become
sponsors of measures like preventive detention. They functioned as a
constitutional Opposition seeking to limit the operation of the Bill to a
shorter period and to a few specified States. In the Select Committee, the
Government made important concessions like those relating to the furnishing of
fresh reasons for a fresh detention, and the supply of confidential documents
to the members of the Advisory Boards. Finally the Home Minister promised to
bring up the new Act for reconsideration at the end of an year. He was glad to
oblige the veteran publicists who si</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ncerely sought to improve the Bill.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Of
an entirely different character was the opposition of the Communists and their
allies. While, for the time being, they are in Parliament as representatives of
the people elected on universal suffrage, they have not altogether abandoned
violence in their extra-parliamentary activities. They claim the right to
retain their arms for use at a moment’s notice, and they assume the tone of
victors in a civil war dictating terms. Their speeches on the Bill left no room
for doubt about their intentions. Their ultimate aim is to seize power through
a violent revolution, if necessary, and liquidate all parties but their own. No
one need be deceived by their professions of democracy, for their general
attitude to the Constitution and to orderly Party Government is a negation of </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>democracy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Home Minister made it clear that the Bill was not directed against any Party as
such, but only against individuals or groups in regard to whom a reasonable
suspicion exists that they are trying to undermine the tranquility of the State.
It can be no pleasure to a great democrat like Nehru to place on the Statute
Book a measure restricting the liberty of the individual. But he is confronted
with a situation in which the freedom of the Nation, won after a prolonged
struggle with a foreign power, is threatened by disruptive forces,–feudal,
communal, and revolutionary. Preventive detention becomes a necessary evil for
the protection of national freedom. How long it will continue to be necessary
will depend on the attitude of those in opposition who, in the name of
individual liberty, threaten the foundations of the State.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

agreement reached between the Governments of India and Kashmir recognises the
special position of that State and its right to be treated differently from
other ‘Part B’ States. When the Maharaja of Kashmir and the leaders of the
National Conference agreed to accede to the Indian Union, it was in respect of
the three subjects of Defence, External Affairs and Communications. There was
no mental reservation on either side about the genuineness of the accession or
its validity. Kashmir became a part of the territory of India. But while
complete integration with India was achieved in regard to all other States,
Kashmir sought to frame its own Constitution through a Constituent Assembly.
Among the major decisions of the Assembly is that relating to the election of
the Head of the State subject to the approval of the President of India, and
the regulation of citizenship rights with a view to exclude undesirable
foreigners who might infiltrate into the State and impair its safety.
Considering the proximity of Pakistan and the peculiar circumstances in which
the accession of Kashmir took place, the Government of India accepted the
decisions of the Assembly. The present agreement is, however, to be followed by
further negotiations for the purpose of securing greater uniformity in the
relations between the Union </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and the States.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Representatives
of other ‘Part B’ States in Parliament are not happy about the special
concessions made in the case of Kashmir. If Maharaja Hari Singh of Kashmir–who
acceded to India–is deposed and his son is merely elected as Head of the State
for five years, why should the Nizam of Hyderabad, who fought against the
Union, continue to function as the Rajpramukh of the State? But it is important
to remember, in this connection, that hereditary rulership has been abolished
allover India, and the Rajpramukhs retain office only so long as the President
recognises them. That recognition may be withdrawn at any time. No occasion has
so far arisen for the exercise of the President’s powers, and meanwhile there
is no difference whatsoever in the constitutional position of the Governors of
‘Part A’ States and the Rajpramukhs of ‘Part B’ States. It is not necessary to
precipitate a crisis at this stage on an issue which is not of fundamental
importance. Kashmir is bound, sometime later, to fall in line with the rest of
India. What is of immediate consequence is the peaceful settlement of the
dispute between India and Pakistan regarding Kashmir. The forthcoming
negotiations at Geneva may be fruitful or they may not. But nothing should be
done to force the pace of events inside Kashmir by insisting on the complete
and immediate integration of Kashmir. The suggestion to merge Jammu with India,
and separate it from the rest of the State, can only lead to the eventual
partition of Kashmir, on which Pakistan has set her heart.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h1>Cultural Academies</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is a widespread urge in all parts of India to bring together the poets, artists
and scholars, and promote friendly understanding between them. From time to
time there is a brief spurt of activity. Manifestoes are issued, conferences
organised, and committees appointed for the constitution of Academies of Arts and
Letters. But with the solitary exception of the P. E. N. India Centre, no
India-wide cultural organisation has yet emerged. The National Commission of
the <i>UNESCO, </i>and the committees appointed by the Government of India
after the Delhi Conferences early in 1951, have not established the necessary
contacts between the cultural leaders of the different States. The organisation
envisaged by Sri K. M. Munshi is still-born, and from the start, it was
vitiated by a too-obvious desire to establish the primacy of Hindi. Writers in
the different languages of India are slowly winning recognition in neighbouring
language-areas through the occasional translation of poems or stories direct
from one language to another, or into a common language like English or Hindi. But
this work has to be done on a much wider scale and with ample financial
resources. Dr. C. Kunhan Raja rightly emphasises the need for State initiative
in this matter. He pleads for a South Indian Academy of Letters, of which the
foundation members representing the four South Indian languages and Samskrit
should be nominated by the Governor of Madras and the Rajpramukhs of Mysore and
Travancore-Cochin. This will mean a good beginning, and it may lead to an
all-India organisation where every important language of India will find
adequate recognition. The main effort of any cultural academy must be directed
to the improvement of the position of the writers. Their writings must be
published, reviewed, and adequately rewarded. Younger writers must be sought out
from obscure corners and greater warmth and tenderness displayed towards them.
At present most of them feel ‘left out’. In free India, the conditions have to
be provided in which Art and Literature can flourish and enrich the culture of
the nation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

appointed with Dr. A. L. Mudaliar as chairman. The question of the reform and
reorganisation of education is naturally bound up with the provision of
adequate funds. But the Central Government’s Ministry on Education fares like
the proverbial Cinderella in the matter of allocation of finances. The position
may improve during the next few years, and with wise planning and co-ordination
of effort between the Centre and the States, education at all levels may become
widespread and efficient.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

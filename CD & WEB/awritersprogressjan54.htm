nature <span class=SpellE>Binu</span> was indolent. He was averse to effort of
any kind. He liked to stroll and did his thinking as he paced up and down. He
liked to stretch out at full length and dreamt or read as he reclined. He did
not like to sit in one place and therefore he did not eat well, converse well
or correspond well. What could force such a person to sit down to the creation
of literature? If there had been no urge, no insistent need, he could not have
done so; he would have jumped up and run away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

hanker after fame at all would be an <span class=GramE>exaggeration</span>. <span
class=GramE>But to exert himself for it?</span> That was another thing. The
‘duty’ he spoke of was of course social and humanitarian. He understood very
well that his efforts would not produce literature, but he was more bent upon
breaking down prejudices and reforming society than upon art for art’s sake. He
had set himself to prove the worthlessness of the customs, inherited beliefs
and conventions that have been so highly prized so long and to smash current
pre-conceived notions. If for this he had to write a novel he would. He put
himself to the trouble of sitting down and holding a pen in order to carry on
his work of demolition. This demolition was not to be pure destruction however.
Reformers destroy but, like a river, they break down one bank only to build the
other higher. They also know how to construct. To dream of a new<i> </i>society

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
answer to the question why he should write was duty. But there is another
question. How was he to write? The answer to that was, not just anyhow. <span
class=SpellE>Binu</span> was always very fastidious about the way he wrote, his
style. Others could specify the subject: examiners pleased themselves. <span
class=SpellE>Binu</span> could, however, dispose of the subject in his own way.
<span class=GramE>As the proverb says: Eat to please yourself but dress to
please others.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>, ease-loving as he
was, took the greatest pains with his style, developing it sometimes
conversationally, sometimes on paper, sometimes mentally. Correspondence is
also writing of a kind. There is a saying that God must be remembered in the
forest, in the heart, and in corners. Writing is similar. <span class=SpellE>Binu</span>
did not relax his efforts for a single day nor did he compromise. He displayed
his style even in his examination papers, and was <span class=SpellE>penalised</span>
for it. He was also rewarded. He refused to write just anyhow even for
newspapers and, though he wrote about social reforms, his manner was
distinctive. Whether it was good or bad did not concern him; it was enough that
it was his own.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>For this he had to apprentice himself to many, in
the first instance to ‘<span class=SpellE>Birbal</span>’, then to Rabindranath
and lastly to Gandhiji. The style is the man. To separate a style from the
stylist in order to learn it is like trying to separate moonlight from the
moon. It is neither possible nor desirable. <span class=SpellE>Binu</span> did
not content himself with an analysis of the style of those he chose as
teachers; he sought the reality behind the appearance. A person is open to the
influence of another as long as his own character is vague. The influence
passes away upon self-discovery. To attempt to free oneself from an influence
before then is like trying to jump out of a boat before it reaches the landing
place.</p>

imitation ceases. From then on one gives oneself, makes oneself known. Until

should he write? The answer was, in <span class=GramE>his own</span> way. There
was another question. For whom was he to write? A study of ‘<span class=SpellE>Birbal’s</span>’
writings revealed that he wrote for men of feeling. He was unwilling to proffer
his emotional experiences to those who lack feeling. How few men of feeling
there are in the world! Even when education is universal it will not be
possible to count them by the dozen! The inevitable conclusion is that ‘<span
class=SpellE>Birbal</span>’ did not write for the general reader. <span
class=GramE>And Rabindranath?</span> Of his works some are for men of feeling,
some for men of imagination, and some for <span class=SpellE><i>sadhakas</i></span><i>.

<span class=SpellE>criticised</span> his own work, composed fairy tales for
peasants and repented of having written; <i>War and Peace, Anna Karenina, </i>all,
in fact, of his masterpieces. There is nothing in the history of literature
like it. Ordinarily we lose ourselves in rapt admiration of even our most
faulty <span class=GramE>creations,</span> we take a blind parental pride in
our offspring, not to speak of repentance. Tolstoy showed no mercy to his
finest work because it was beyond the intelligence and learning of peasants and
primitives, because a twelve-year-old boy would not be moved by it as deeply as
an old man of seventy-two, because neither would be prompted by it to embrace
his fellow-men as brothers and to forgive them their misdeeds, because it was
written for a handful of wealthy, educated, <span class=SpellE>civilised</span>
and leisured parasites. Tolstoy of course overdid it. He went to extremes in
everything he did. He had enjoyed his youth like a <span class=SpellE>Bhartrihari</span>,
and in his later days his sense of guilt was acute. He cursed his pen when it
occurred to him that he was writing for sinners. He did not care to see a

peasant and the savage, the boatman and the disposer of the dead. <span

If they are not, it does not matter, for words spoken with a home thrust, in

Tolstoy had for its object not the acquisition of style but the outgrowing of
it. He does not remember when his apprenticeship began and it is still
incomplete. A time comes in the life of a writer when he wants to identify himself
with his reader, when he does not want anything to stand between them. The
thinnest partition pains him. For the literary initiate, as for the religious
acolyte, the last word is <span class=SpellE><i>sarvat</i></span><i> <span
class=SpellE>tanmayo</span> <span class=SpellE>bhavet</span>, </i>complete
union. Style is a help up to the point of union but at that point it becomes an
obstacle. If the faithful friend does not take leave at the entrance to the <span
class=SpellE>arbour</span> of love, she ceases to be a friend and becomes a
co-wife.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Tolstoy nothing at all is kept back. He gives his reader all he has at the
moment to give, life, youth, sin, virtue, wisdom, folly. He wanted to be one
with the reader and he seems to have succeeded. The enemy of the writer, as of
the acolyte, is his self-esteem, the tinkle of his jewelry, the clang of his
pride. Has she, who comes to her Divine Lover tricked out in all her frippery,
left any of herself free for an embrace? Silks and gems cover her entire
person. The best heroine, the greatest initiate, is she who removes these
trinkets, she who has overcome their fascination. So it is with the best
writer. His ultimate reader is the inner soul of all men. <span class=GramE>“In
this person is That Person,” as the <span class=SpellE>bauls</span> say.</span>

is so not only in the case of style. Tolstoy abandoned his home a few days
before his death. It was necessary for him to bring himself to that point in
order to keep faith with life. ‘What magic is powerful enough to make the
writing of a person true whose life is not true? A time came when <span
class=SpellE>Binu’s</span> thoughts turned from society to life itself. In this
too <span class=SpellE>Tol~toy</span> was his guru. His analysis of the
essential and unessential bore a resemblance to Tolstoy’s, the young Tolstoy’s,

The answer is that an epic is not the creation of any single person. Before
Valmiki gave the <i>Ramayana </i>a permanent form, many others had given it a
transient one. Some of them were <span class=SpellE><i>charans</i></span><i> </i>or
bards, some panegyrists or <span class=SpellE><i>bhats</i></span><i>, </i>some

</i>is, so to speak, the creation of a whole nation. So is the <i>Mahabharata. </i>To
say so is not to belittle the genius of <span class=SpellE>Vyas</span> or of
Valmiki. Not to say so is to leave unsolved the riddle of the creation of an
epic. There are no epics today because modern <span class=GramE>nations,</span>
do not do things in an epic way. <span class=GramE>No tale nor</span>
collection of tales comparable to the <i>Ramayana </i>and <i>Mahabharata </i>has
wide currency. There is only the dalliance of <st1:place w:st="on">Krishna</st1:place>.

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
shall we give up all hope of an epic? No, the individual must do what he can.
Tolstoy gave an epic to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
his <i>War and Peace. </i><span class=SpellE>Romain</span> Rolland gave to <st1:place

partakes of the nature of an epic, the composer Beethoven being the model for

purpose of an epic; it is the gospel of modern European life, West European.
The hero is not the hero of bloody battles but the hero of a way of life.
Beethoven’s life is the silent answer to the question of how to live, how life

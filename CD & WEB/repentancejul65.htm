stars had just begun to pale in the early morning sky. In the old house the
first oil dips were lit. The sound of splashing water came from the shed in
which the tube-well stood. In a long dark room a young girl lay. Her face was
thin and sallow. She slept with an arm thrown over her head, while her father
sat on a webbing stool near her string cot. He had spent the night like this,
so that she could be awakened every few hours to take her medicine. A cold sweat
stood on her forehead and he gently wiped it away with a towel. He was relieved
that the crisis had passed, and that she now lay restfully. Typhoid was
rampant, and there were many cases in the village. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

door of the bathing shed squeaked on its old hinges as a woman of about forty
emerged. Her dark wet hair hung down her back and her sari was loosely draped
about her. She went about the house sprinkling water and intoning a prayer. She
shivered slightly m the early morning chill. The house was quiet and her bare
feet softly paddled the floor. Cocks <span class=GramE>crowing</span> to each
other shattered the stillness. From the <span class=SpellE>cattleshed</span> in
the courtyard, came the insistent lowing of their cow. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

patience, you mad creature,” she muttered half affectionately and half angrily
as she pulled on her long-sleeved blouse and knotted her heavy wet hair. She
picked up a shining brass pail and assuring herself that her daughter lay
sleeping, went out from the back door into the cold and mist of the courtyard.
She instinctively pulled the end of her sari across her face, holding it in
place with her teeth. <span class=GramE>Soon the metallic hiss of the warm milk
as it struck the pail could be heard, and the murmuring of the woman to the
cow, interrupted by the sound of an occasional slap on the cow’s shanks.</span>

she milked the cow, <span class=SpellE>Heerawanti</span> thought how lucky it
was that they had <span class=SpellE>Ajit</span> in the house. <span

practitioner without a practice. He was confirmed </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>bachelor
and, since he had enough money for his personal use from the joint family
property, he had never cared to start a practice. He attended the family of his
brother and numerous relations, for which he accepted no money, and avidly read
the medical journals to which he subscribed. They were the last of a long line
of Punjabi <span class=SpellE>zamindars</span>, <span class=GramE>who</span>
had been compelled to sell most of their land when the new laws came into
force. Even so, they had enough to last them their lifetime, and though they
could not live in the manner that they had been accustomed to, they still
managed without anxiety or want. Above all, they were still among the richest
people in the village, envied and disliked by their poorer <span class=SpellE>neighbours</span>
because of their pride and haughtiness. Their daughter <span class=SpellE>Vimala</span>
was not allowed to mix with the villagers, and most of her friends lived in the
nearest town, where she went to school. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

pail of frothy milk and started to light the wood fire. She listened with
irritation to the gentle snoring of their young boy-servant, from where he lay
on the coal sacks, covered from head to foot in a cheap <span class=SpellE>coloured</span>
cotton sheet. The wood caught fire and she patiently blew at the flames through
an iron pipe. The acrid smoke billowed out and her eyes began to water. She
sniffed and wiped her eyes with her sari. Before long the water boiled and she
made the tea. The two brass tumblers standing before her were filled and there
was some left in the pot for the servant. <span class=SpellE>Ajit</span> had
gone to the town to get a fresh supply of medicine. He would not come back till
evening, having spent the night at the home of a relative. Holding the hot
tumbler of tea with the folded end of her sari, she went to the room where her
husband was sitting with <span class=SpellE>Vimala</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

stood half bowed and with folded hands. Her shirt and baggy trousers were

cloth which was draped over her head and shoulders was grimy and her hair was
unkempt. <span class=SpellE>Heerawanti</span> recognized Ram <span

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>As <span class=SpellE>Heerawanti</span> served the
food to the two men, she glanced at her brother-in-law’s tired face. What was
the use of telling him about Ram <span class=SpellE>Pyari</span>, she thought.
Could he cure all the sick people in the village? And so she put the thought of
Ram <span class=SpellE>Pyari</span> out of her mind. </p>

evening <span class=SpellE>Heerawanti</span> was standing on the terrace of her
house. She looked out across the fields idly. At one side, the grass lay green
like the feathers on a parrot’s breast. Just as she was about to go down, her
attention was caught by a group of people standing on the outskirts of the
village. She watched them intently, for it was here that they cremated the
dead. After a short while, a thin wisp of smoke rose up to the orange-streaked
sky. <span class=SpellE>Heerawanti</span> called down to the inner courtyard,
where the young servant was cutting fodder. “Go and find out who has died in
our village,” she cried. The boy left his work and ran out. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

impatiently for his return. Her guilty conscience smote her, and she stood
breathlessly. It seemed like hours before the lad returned, but soon she
perceived him loping along towards the house. When he came up to her on the
terrace, he said, “<span class=SpellE>Mataji</span>, it is nobody important. <span

guilt overwhelmed her and pity flooded her mind. Now, on looking back, she felt
that she should not have taken it upon herself to answer for the doctor. Poor

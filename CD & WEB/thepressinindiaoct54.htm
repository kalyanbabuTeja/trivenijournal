<h1>FUTURE OF PAPERS IN ENGLISH</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The future of Indian newspapers and periodicals
published in English presents an important problem. With the formation of linguistic
States and the conduct of their administration in the regional languages, the
influence of the language papers is bound to grow. The speeches in the State
legislatures will be mostly in the local languages, and they will be reported
with accuracy in the language papers while the papers in English will carry
only <span class=SpellE>summarised</span> translations. Even in literary
journalism, the leadership will rest with the periodicals published in the
Indian languages. I do not, therefore, look forward to any further growth in
the number or influence of the papers in English. But yet they have a vital
role to play in inter-State and inter-National spheres. Ever after the 15-year
limit set by the Constitution, English will continue to be employed in a large
measure in those spheres. It will be taught compulsorily, as a language, in the
higher forms of the High Schools and in Colleges. The Central Parliament will
be bilingual–employing Hindi and English in nearly equal proportions. <span
class=GramE>So too the Central Government and judiciary.</span> It is my belief
that in every leading city of <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
there will be one or two first-rate dailies shaping public opinion in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> and
abroad, and setting up standards for the language papers to follow. Independent
India must also find place for at least half-a-dozen monthlies and Quarterlies
with an all-India status, interpreting the regional cultures to other regions
and other countries. In this particular field, they will serve as ambassadors
of culture. </p>

Indeed, there could be no worthier models to follow. For centuries the leading

battled for the right. They functioned as the tribunes of the people, and
preserved the hard-won liberties. The work of the Press was thus complementary
to that of the political leaders who stood up for liberty of thought and
expression. We have a similar story in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Our fight for freedom was
waged on many fronts; but the platform and the Press were the most important of

men at the helm of a newspaper must be alert. They must be men of insight and
vision who can grasp the inwardness of a situation, feel the pulse of the
public, and body forth the yet unspoken thoughts of the masses of men. This is
an instinct which is akin to genius, and every great Editor is something of a
prophet too. And if he is utterly sincere and unselfish, he rarely goes wrong.
He is able to function simultaneously as the reflector and guide of public
opinion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

newspaper voluntarily imposes on itself certain restraints, so as not to
transgress against God, or the State, or the reputation of individual wielders
of power. Criticism, even strong criticism, is an inherent right, but the
exercise of it is conditioned by the equal rights of others. Criticism of
measures, rather than of men, must be the main objective, though it is
sometimes difficult to draw the line between men and the measures they sponsor
when in office. But it is a salutary rule to avoid the imputation of evil motives,
unless the evidence is overwhelming.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
wise Government, wedded to the democratic tradition, will not seek to fetter
the Press. Any restraints that it may be called upon to impose on the Press
during a period of war or other great <span class=GramE>crisis,</span> are of a
temporary nature. But even in normal times, the State, in the interests of
public order, has to enact laws applicable to the Press. Incitement to violence
the promotion of hatred between different sections of the public, and indulgence
in obscenity, are some of the major evils a State has to guard against. In the
case of the professed guardian of the public welfare like a democratic Press, a
Government should exercise the greatest caution when bringing in legislation
seeking to control the newspapers. It is not<i> </i>enough that popularly
elected legislatures <span class=SpellE>scrutinise</span> such a Bill before it
becomes law. The gentlemen of the Press must themselves be consulted, and
charged with the duty of maintaining standards of conduct within their profession.
Violent and unbridled criticism is certainly an evil, but, in the effort to
prevent it, even the right type of criticism is apt to be stifled. It is
necessary to preserve freedom of expression, without giving rein to license.
This becomes possible through an understanding between the representatives of
the Press and the State.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>But the freedom of the Press has implications other
than the absence of restraints imposed by the State through legislation or
executive orders. Where the Press is fast ceasing to be a vocation, and taking
on the character of an industry, the influence of the money power may become a
menace to the freedom of the Press. The fabulously rich industrialist is not
content to ply his trade and enjoy the comfort that the possession of wealth
brings with it. He must acquire political power through getting his men elected
to the legislatures, and, even more, through control over the Press. One way of
controlling the Press is by owning a newspaper or chains of newspapers, and
paying a competent staff to function as mouthpieces of his views on all matters
of public interest. Another is to win over the Press through his power of
patronage in the shape of advertisements on a huge scale. The money power works
in insidious ways, and saps the vitality of the Press. Friends of democracy and
champions of the people’s right to a free <span class=GramE>Press,</span> must
devise means to protect the Press from the encroachments of the <span
class=SpellE>monied</span> interests, quite as much as from encroachments by
the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Yet another danger to the Press arises from the
impact of mass opinion. In their anxiety to give to the public what the public
is supposed to want, the leaders in the world of Journalism unconsciously betray
the true interests of that public. If the papers feed the public on sensation,
the public acquires a taste for sensational news and for stories of violent
crime. The taste grows on what is served. It is an unhealthy sign when the
Press of a country panders to an ignorant public, and sinks to the level of
sensation-mongers. The truth is that large elements in a nation’s life are
fundamentally sound. Their instincts are healthy. The Press is not called upon
to stray from the straight path, and corrupt the public taste. All writing
meant for the public must <span class=GramE>he</span> bright, lively, and
interesting. But there is no need, acting on wrong assumptions of popular
requirements, to <span class=SpellE><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt'>vulgarise</span></span><span

prominence. In the search for smart and </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>sensational headlines,
a wrong twist is given to the news. For instance, some newspapers have
developed the habit of giving what are called ‘streamer’ headlines. Anyone can
see that events of outstanding significance like the assassination of Mahatma
Gandhi or the inauguration of the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Indian</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Republic</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> do not happen
every day. By racking your brains for the wording of a streamer headline from
day to day, you are obliged to give undue importance to ordinary occurrences,
just because there must be some kind of a thundering headline. Even in the
disposition of the news over the columns on a single page, some papers present
the appearance of a <span class=SpellE>zig-zag</span> puzzle. Such featuring is
a hindrance rather than a help to the reader. It confuses him and even misleads
him with regard to the significance of the news items.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>An enterprising circulation manager is not <span
class=GramE>Content</span> with enlisting subscribers and selling copies
through agencies. To him, that is just ‘normal’ business. He must be on the
look-out for abnormal ways of increasing his sales. Some papers run
competitions of cross-word puzzles. There may be many ways of solving the
puzzle, and one solution is as good as another; but the money prizes, running
into four or five figures, can be won only by those fortunate individuals whose
solutions tally exactly with the particular solution arrived at by the office
of the paper, or come nearest to it. Here is something of a gamble, and every
aspirant sends in a number of solutions, hoping that at least one of them might
approximate to the all-correct one. And for this purpose, he has to purchase a
number of copies of the paper, which obviously he does not read. All these
methods are really extraneous to the main purpose of journalism–the
dissemination of news and the shaping of opinion. There is a growing volume of
discontent against such methods, and some Governments have sought to prohibit
them.</p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>value
of the technical and business staff, and underrate the services of the real
makers of a newspaper or journal. I refer to the Editor-in-chief the heads of
the various sections of the editorial department, and the host of
assistant-editors; and sub-editors and correspondents, without whose active
co-operation no journal of high quality can be produced. The framework of
technicians and business managers is indeed necessary for the successful
functioning of a newspaper. But ultimately it is the quality of the writing
that tells. The editorial <span class=GramE>staff write</span> out valuable
stuff dealing with the main problems of the day, in addition to putting into
shape the huge mass of manuscripts passing through their hands. It is they,
again, who keep in touch with the progress of knowledge in various fields, and
send out requests for special articles to persons who have mastered their
subjects and can write with clarity. The editorial staff which thus wins
special distinction for a paper is not usually rewarded in an adequate measure.
Comparing their emoluments with these enjoyed by men of similar ability and
equipment in the permanent services of a State or in the realms of law,
industry and finance, one notes with regret the shabby treatment accorded to
these talented persons, who not only reflect public opinion, but shape and
guide it. The journalists of modern <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> have learnt to look upon
their profession as something of a mission. Their zeal is so great that they
make light of hardships. To them, journalism is not just a trade or an
occupation. And yet, it is hardly fair to discount their services and take
advantage of their idealism. This is an aspect of journalism, on its business
side, which has not received the attention it deserves. The working
journalists, like the lecturers in our colleges and Universities, are among the
lowest paid intellectuals in any land. In different ways, these are the
educators of the nation, and it is only the consciousness of service rendered
with devotion which sustains them in difficult moments.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Politics
and economics play a large part in a nation’s life under modern conditions. But
they do not exhaust a nation’s wide range of interests. Art and literature,
sport and pastime, science and industry, philosophy and religion, appeal in
varying degrees to large sections of the public. The leading newspapers always <span
class=SpellE>recognise</span> this position, and devote space to items of
interest bearing on these topics. But it is to the weeklies and the monthlies
that the public must turn for fuller treatment of these subjects. These
periodicals are produced at greater leisure; the writers have more time to
collect their material and present it in an attractive manner. They are like a
half-way house between the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>daily papers produced at top-speed, and
the volumes of learned </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>treatises which take years to write. The
periodicals cater to a select, but cultivated group of readers. They thus
influence the opinions of those who in their turn influence the general public.
It is to the growth of the periodicals that we must look for the evolution of
an independent, cultured, and educative type of journalism. Appraisal of new
movements in painting and sculpture, criticism of the stage and screen, reviews
of poetry and fiction, disquisitions on contemporary science and current trends
in politics and philosophy, will appeal to a cultured audience. Periodicals can
be so edited as to serve as extension schools.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h1>A WORD ABOUT ‘TRIVENI’</h1>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Triveni’
was born on the 25th of December 1927. Twenty five years is a long period, and
Indian journals which have completed it are very few indeed. In the case of
‘Triveni’ one could never foretell how long it would last; so, when it survived
the first year, friends heaved a sigh of relief and welcomed the event as
something of a phenomenon. The journal grew in years and in beauty, while there
was a progressive decline in my ability to finance it. I ran through some
borrowed capital, and then sold bits of ancestral property. Finally, I sought
the co-operation of friends like Sri K. <span class=SpellE>Chandrasekharan</span>
and the late Justice V. <span class=SpellE>Govindarajachari</span> to raise
life-subscriptions and donations at frequent intervals to cover the mounting
annual deficits. Then came the troublesome days of the partial evacuation of <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Madras</st1:City></st1:place> for fear of bombing
during the <span class=GramE>second world war</span>. ‘Triveni’ then migrated
to Bangalore and found a home for seven years, under the guardianship of Sri <span
class=SpellE>Masti</span> <span class=SpellE>Venkatesa</span> <span
class=SpellE>Iyengar</span> and the new Associate Editor, Sri K. Sampathgiri
Rao. Today ‘Triveni’ is being published as a Quarterly from <span class=SpellE>Masulipatam</span>,
having been by turns a two-monthly, a monthly, a quarterly, and again a
monthly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

recent years, several journals of this type have disappeared for lack of financial
support. This will affect adversely the cultural life of the country, and a
national Government interested in culture must come to the rescue of such
journals. But if high standards are to be maintained, the subventions or grants
should be “without any strings,” and similar to the grants to Universities and
societies for scientific research. A periodical might not make a profit nor
even pay its way, from its subscription and advertisement revenue. And yet it
might uphold values which are of the utmost significance to the future of the
nation and of humanity. The Commission can suggest ways and means to strengthen
this section of the Indian Press.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

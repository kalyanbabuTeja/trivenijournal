</FONT><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Political Philosophers since 1905, Vol. II, Part II. The Epoch of Neo-Democracy and Neo-Socialism (1929)–</I>Prof. Benoy Kumar Sarkar, M,A., &amp;. Dr. h. c. Published by Motilal Banarsidass, Lahore, Rs: 12/-</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prof. Benoy Kumar Sarkar has become a legend in his own life time,–so phenomenal have been his studies and writings on Sociology and kindred subjects. Anyone aware of the sheer quantity of his work is sure to feel a sense of awe at the sight of such energy and patient industry. English and Continental, no less than American and Asian fields of, observation are before him when making those ample comments on the men and things which he is analysing or apprising.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The work under review is Vol. II of his &quot;Political Philosophies since 1905&quot;. It covers the history and scans the face of the world even as his volume I did. His definition of Political Philosophy is inclusive and comprehends every type of human endeavour and impulse to organization and conduct which arises, and disturbs, or shapes international polity. A distinctive approach fairly analytical, objective and realistic with characteristic comments and style–already well known as Sarkarism–is present ever to add ‘pep’ and tone-quality to his writing. Whether he studies a purely economic or a political problem his knowledge of more than a few European languages helps him to ride like a colossus, who if he strides with heavy, conscious steps can still march sure to the end of his journey safe and well. It is an earlier and bulkier age which, therefore, is here on view rather than ours which is a more specialised, a more lightly built one, more like fork-lightning an sheet. But Prof. Sarkar’s help in summarising Reports, Books and positions makes the equivalent of whole libraries and political atlases available to students of the subject. His running commentaries have the assurance and vitality of an all-consuming all-seeing mind. A conclusion or comment may be contested here and there, as when he speaks about the classical school of Economists in England or on the Planners in America, Germany or Russia. He may give short shrift to other opinions than his own and claim priorities in wisdom as, for example, in connection with Sir M. Visvesvaraya’s programme of planning, and refer endlessly to his own articles and books in more than one language. But his observations are full-blooded and come very much out of a mind well stocked with information. It is not usually prejudiced by any ‘ism’, nor narrowly loyal to any sectional or even national programmes: which, in a student of human affairs, is compensation for any or all smaller lacks.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">His choice of 1905 as the starting year of study has been explained more than once by now for it was in that year that Asia emerged as a definite tendency if not even as a factor in world politics. Young Asia was born with a desire to hold Asia for the Asiatics; with Japan defeating Russia and rousing China, India, Turkey unmistakably in its wake. He takes the period between 1905–? through four stages, the third perhaps ending with the close of this war,–which he puts tentatively at 1945,–and the 4th running up to, say 1965, when the world will again gird up to and plunge into the next global war with more ferocious combinations of powers to achieve more decisive results. He is sure that Asia will play no weak or uncertain part in such a conflict more as an equal than as a satellite or subject force; and that war will simply not stop with success but will in its turn sow seeds of much more destructive wars later, perhaps between the white and the non-white races of the world. It is in the nature of these wars to be incessant, and he knows human nature enough to prophesy no respite from them. Rather a depressing forecast this; but on evidence true. The Asia Monroe doctrine, as he calls it is as much a live reality to day as the American; as live as the deadly rivalries between the United Kingdom and Germany or Russia, Germany and England, <I>vis-a-vis </I>each other a term which like Acculturated, Albinocracy, Japanification etc., and host of other foreign terms and polysyllabics is very dear to the writer.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The central theme of his political prophecy is that whatever forces may work in shaping the world process one thing is certain: Rival groups, imperialisms, if you will, with the efficient backing of every resource and influence which science, organization and political pressure can supply them will continue to work for world domination, (Realpolitik), expediency and interest guiding action rather than Thought, Reason, Ethics or Idealism. Every agency, economic, social, psychological, intellectual, technical or organisational will be used to further this real end; the actual motive may be camouflaged by facades of ideology, unfamiliar formalities and modes of behaviour, or by new political usance, but at root it will ever be interest, passion and power-lust of the major powers which now one, now another, singly or in groups strive to hold the rest of the world in thrall. And in this the Asian Powers like Japan and Turkey will no less have to be mistrusted than the European, the American or even the Russian communistic, States. He actually lists seven such Power-groups in the world. Any cry for peace or for outlawry of war, therefore, will be pious pretence just a fond wish of the heart.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prof. Sarkar renders real service when he calls attention to the circumstances that led, say, to the Russian and German Revolutions and asks us to note that all such movements are functions of national history character and need and that essentially one type of organization is not wholly transferable to or to be imitated by another country. The distinctions he draws between fully adult, semi-adult and young nations, so far a technical and industrial ability is concerned, needs also to be borne mind before one plunges into doctrine or rush to fray. If Prof. Sarkar has no illusions, it is not so much because he is not warm-hearted or generous enough, but because he sees all too clearly the dominant incurable persistence in human affairs of the Realpolitik factor, which, hagriding human fortunes has always controlled the destinies of nations. Either MacFleckno of the old <I>Nation </I>and <I>Atheneum </I>or some writer in Punch once remarked that what is needed is not so much a stabilisation of economies, of prices, wages, or currencies, or trade or employment simply which is needed to do the trick; but the stabilisation of the head of a Hitler, Stalin or Roosevelt with all that is within and behind it as dark spaces or light, engaged or in reserve. Whatever patterns of behaviour issue from the present war, it will but surely prepare the scale and character of the next, when the Furies will rage more hungrily than ever for blood and destruction. Power politics historical memories, and <I>revanche</I> will for a good time yet, define the frame-work, set the direction, and settle the tone, temper and terms, of all other branches of existence and striving. Therefore, pure studies and theories of Economics, Ethics and Social organization are bound to be unreal if divorced from their immediate contexts, mere pastimes or exercises of the intellect unable either to direct or determine conduct.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reviewing this volume is like reviewing the world; and must be as imperfect a task. We observe here a skilled practitioner as he passes in critical review whole movements, sums up achievements, notes chronological sequences, assesses work and submits <I>ad interim </I>balance-sheets of assets and liabilities. If repetition and occasional pompousness or pedantry distract, that is a small failing; for we are aware all along of our indebtedness to his work, which has done very much in India through English and Bengali to promote the collection and spread of valuable sociological information among his people these three-four decades at least. And our own tribute of regard goes to a scholar whose studies are frankly real and characterised by honesty, courage and love of truth.</P>

<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amaravati Sculptures in the Madras Government Museum</I>–By C. Sivarama Murti, M.A., Curator, of the Archaeological Section,–Bulletin of the Museum, New Series, Vol. IV, –Published by the Superintendent, Govt. Museum, Madras, Price Rs. 14–8–0.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a very welcome addition to the admirable series of publications, which the authorities of the Museum at Madras have been able to bring out from time to time.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Krishna Valley in the Madras Presidency was the seat of Buddhism at the beginning of the Christian era and the stupa at Amaravati near Guntur was the most glorious work of Art belonging to that period. Ever since this was discovered in the last years of the 18th century and made known to the public by Burgess through his treatise in 1887, it has attracted the attention of scholars all over the world. But by the time scholars began to take notice of the same very little had been left of the original structure and a good number of carved slabs abstracted from their original setting had been removed from the spot. Excavations were carried out by Mr. A. Rae, the then Superintendent of Archaeology in Madras in the years 1905–1908 and these yielded more interesting finds.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Scholars, both Indian and foreign, have since studied these relics and have made valuable contributions to the knowledge of the develop talent of Buddhist Art in India. Mr. Sivarama Murti, than whom no better scholar could be thought of to do justice to this kind of work, has placed all lovers of Art under a deep debt of gratitude by bringing all the available material on the subject into one compass and presenting it in a systematic and scientific way with the results of his own investigations. Mr. Murti is a careful student of Archaeology and a very fine-artist addition, a rare combination not usually met with among archaeologists. He has treated the subject exhaustively from various points of view and has enriched his publication with a number of good photographs and a set of beautiful sketches from his own hand.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The monograph begins with a historical introduction, which includes a general description of the ancient town of Amaravati and its antiquities and the history of the Satavahana Kings. He then discusses the different schools of Buddhism found in the country at that time and furnishes a thesis on the nature and development of stupas in general. All this makes very interesting reading and shows the thoroughness with which Mr. Murti has gone into the subject. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr. Murti classifies the sculptures found at Amaravati into four periods–First period: 200–100 B. C., Second period; 100 A. D., Third period: 150 A.D., and Fourth period: 200–250 A.D. every period showing its own type of human anatomy, dress, ornaments, poses and grouping and depicting successive stages of advance in technique and refinement. A general survey of the Art found at Amaravati is next given and his studies of the relics found reveal the cultural side of the people who lived in that age.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are in all sixty-five plates to illustrate the Volume, thirteen of which are line drawings being sketches from his own hand and the rest photographs. To each one of these are added notes which are very illuminating and scholarly.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He has also made a careful study of inscriptions found there and has printed the text and translations of all of them with necessary appendices giving the names, both geographical and personal, together with a glossary of words that occur in them. A fairly long Bibliography and a very valuable index are added at the end which enhance the usefulness of the publication for students. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the author says, the art traditions of the Satavahanas are great and are the result of the development of art all over the land for ages. To quote his own words: &quot;The art of the sculptors of Amaravati, like all great art, is national rather than provincial. There is as great a link between the art at Amaravati about the first two centuries A. D. and contemporary art at Nasik or Kanheri, as between the earliest fragments from Amaravati and Jaggayyapeta and the Bharhut railing……..Just as centuries of stiff and rigid sculpture in Egypt, lacking in variety of pose and flexion, the rather rigid figures of Bharhut gradually shaped themselves into forms in innumerable <I>bhangas </I>with soft features full of grace….The sculptor at Amaravati was as much a peasant at heart as a courtier in his tastes...The Education of the sculptor in the Empire of the Satavahanas was not confined to the methods of chiselling. He was well-read in literature and knew well many of the allied arts...Amaravati art that continued and fostered earlier traditions, itself inspired later art. The Satavahana tradition is continued in the Chalukyan sculptures…..The traditions of Amaravati have traveled south and enriched Pallava Sculpture, and the art that was inspired by this traveled from here beyond the seas and determined the styles of sculptures far away in Java and other places.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr. Sivarama Murti deserves to be congratulated on the splendid manner in which he has dealt with the subject and for the quality of high scholarship and artistic sensibility which he has brought to, bear in intepretation of it.</P>

<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Women and Social Injustice</I>,–By M. K. Gandhi, (Published by the Navajivan Publishing House, Ahmedabad. Foreword by Amrit Kaur Pages 276. Price Rs. 2/-.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gandhiji has tackled many a social and religious problem confronting the India of today both in his speeches and writings. And what he has to say about our women-folk–their disabilities and the remedies he suggests–deserves to be studied with respectful attention. For Gandhiji is a reformer and thinker in one. ‘No man has evoked such whole-hearted devotion from women.’ In response to his call all classes of women in India came out of their seclusion at the time of Salt Satyagraha in 1930, to mention one instance, and many of them shamed the men-folk by their endurance and bravery.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gandhiji approaches his problems, sociological or otherwise, with a keenness and perspicacity all his own. As he has so aptly said in one of his articles on child marriage: &quot;We have many abuses in our midst, moral, social, economical and political. They require patient study, diligent research, delicate handling, accuracy of statement and clear thinking on them, and sober impartial judgment.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is this ‘scientific’ outlook that heightens the value of his writings. We therefore welcome the present publication under review which contains a valuable foreword by Rajkumari Amrit Kaur, who is herself a stalwart and steadfast champion of the Woman’s cause in India.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The themes in the several articles of the present work are no doubt very familiar to us. Gandhiji has spoken fearlessly about proper education for our women, against enforced widowhood, the purdah system, the dedication of girls to temples, prostitution, early marriage, the dowry system and several other social abuses created and sustained by so-called orthodoxy, priest-craft, superstition, ignorance, etc. In 96 articles that are brought together in this volume from Gandhiji’s notes and articles originally written for &quot;Young India&quot; and &quot;Harijan&quot;, we have his views on numerous problems affecting women, and his passionate plea for their equal status, expressed in his own simple and trenchant style.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The ideal is to look upon marriage as a sacrament and, therefore to lead a life of self-restraint in the married estate. Marriage in Hinduism one of the four ashramas. In fact, the other three are based on it. But in modern times marriage has unfortunately come to be regarded purely a physical union. The other three ashramas are all but non-existent.&quot; &quot;It partly accounts for our weakness, indecision narrowness and helplessness. Let us then tear down the purdah with one mighty effort.&quot;...The awakening and emancipation of Indian woman-hood in modern times may be the result of the time spirit. But Gandhiji’s campaigns on behalf of the ‘suppressed’ have embodied that spirit more than can be adequately estimated.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;It seems to me that we must test on the anvil of reason everything that is capable of being tested by it and reject that which does not satisfy it even though it may appear in an ancient garb.&quot; It is thus that Gandhiji has approached all problems and won against odds.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The publishers are to be congratulated on bringing out these classified volumes from Gandhijis writings, which deserve the careful study of every one eager to see the ushering in of a new order in India and the World.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. <I>The Land and its problems </I>by–By Sir T. Vijayaraghavacharya; Oxford Pamphlets on Indian Affairs, No.9, As. 4.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2. <I>Industrialisation</I>–By Mr. P. S. Lokanathan. Oxford Pamphlet on Indian Affairs, Indian Branch, No. 10, As 4.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Oxford University Press deserves to be congratulated on bringing out useful and popular pamphlets like these on problems connected with India’s economic advancement. Within a limited space, Sir T. Vijayaragavacharya has given us an aeroplane survey of Indian Agriculture in his characteristic style. The influence of Indian Agriculture on India’s social structure is next only to that of the Himalayas on her geography Farming, as the Author puts it, is not a business but a tradition.  &quot;To own a field or acquire one is the aspiration which gilds the daily monotony of many a townman’s life. Ploughing, sowing and harvesting are occasions of semi-religious significance.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The War has given an additional fillip to India’s agricultural production. In the words of the author, &quot;from the point of view of world production and supply of materials for the world’s industries, India is one of the foremost countries to-day, and it is not at all unlikely that it will in the not distant future occupy the first rank. An example of what may happen is ready to hand. As recently as 1929, India in the matter of sugar was an importing country. It imported as much as a million tons of sugar from foreign countries, mainly Java for its home consumption. Today, and this position was reached five years ago, it not only produce all the sugar it needs, but has an exportable surplus.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Indian ryot, the author makes it clear, is not as ignorant as he is generally represented to be. &quot;Though often illiterate, he is certainly not deficient in shrewdness, in intelligence and practical wisdom. Through ages of inherited experience he has learned to appreciate the value of regular rotation of crops and knows that fertility of the soil cannot be maintained at the same level, if the same crop is taken too often in consecutive years.&quot; The author rightly refutes the view often held by the experts that the Indian soil has exhausted its fertility and consequently there should be progressive deterioration of the soil.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mechanisation of Agriculture in a country like India is not desirable. &quot;Machines are suitable for new countries with a sparse population and large farms such as Canada, Australia and Argentina, but not far a thick populated country with small holdings. The serious effects of mechanical cultivation in displacing human labour and driving the peasantry into over-crowded towns should not be over-looked.&quot; It has to be insisted that technical progress is not a ‘<I>sine quo non</I>’ of economic advancement. It is Imperative that we realise that the aim of economic reconstruction in India should not be a creation of new zones of technical progress, but dissolution of the old zones of economic distress. It is gratifying to note that the author has not excluded any aspect of Indian agriculture in spite of the limitations of space. The book is suited to everybody’s pocket and deserves to be in the pocket of everybody.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2. <I>Industrialisation</I>–by Mr. Lokanathan–is a timely publication. The War has given an additional stimulus to industrial development; yet, as Mr. Lokanathan points out, there is not that whole-hearted encouragement and co-operation that circumstances justify. The dependence of India’s industry on foreign sources of machinery, capital, equipment and even for spare parts is still a source of considerable weakness in her industrial organisation. From pins, screws and nails to engines and prime movers, everything has to come from abroad. The lack of a strong metallurgical industry, and of subsidiary and auxiliary industries to cater the needs of the established major industries, explains the weakness of Indian industrialisation. The total war orders placed in India were only Rs. 300 crores till the end of 1941 against Rs. 11,000 crores placed in Canada.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However much industrialisation is desirable, it is to be remembered that industrialisation is only a means to increased production, and thereby the increased well-being of the people. This leads the author to take up the question of Cottage Industries and their role in the future economic structure of India. The fear that they will be swamped and ultimately destroyed by modern industry is perhaps groundless. Japanese experience shows that small industries can occupy an important place in modern industrial economy and can exist side by side with large scale industries. The relation between the two is partly competitive and partly complementary. Where they are competitive, it may be necessary, through a public organization, to demarcate the lines of division between the two. Where they are complementary there is less difficulty; indeed, some of the smaller industries would be auxiliary to large-scale industries. India, being in a transition stage, is eminently suited for carrying out this suggestion of the author.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The defects in the existing industrial organisation have been carefully surveyed and remedies suggested. Those who are anxious to see India an industrialised nation will do well to take note of the following:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Out of a population of 124 millions in the United States of America, President Roosevelt wrote in 1933, &quot;American economic life was dominated by some 600 odd corporations, who controlled two-thirds of American industries and 10 million small business men divided the other third.&quot; In India this tendency has already become manifest in the cement, sugar, paper and steel industries. Protection in these industries has only set up syndicalist conspiracies to rob the public of the benefits of technical progress and economic efficiency. Do we want to widen this penumbra of economic servitude? Certainly not. Steps should be taken to prevent such results in India.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The book is neatly got up, well-written and is extremely interesting.</P>

<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Kamana Solu </I>–By A. N. Krishna Rao, Vasantha Granthamala, Bangalore. Price Re. 1/-</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Kamana Solu&quot; is a collection of twelve stories written in Kannada By Sri A. N. Krishna Rao, a popular writer, and published as the first book of the  &quot;Vasantha Granthamala&quot; series, newly started.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The very first story is almost a fantasy with a realistic fore-part. A certain title-holder dies a much mourned death after which he scuds over heaven. This heaven is presented to us as just a replica of the earth abounding in conflicting doctrines. Burlesque more than delicate humour marks the description. But the moral that one’s own humble hut is happier than somebody else’s mansion is well made out. In another story there is a lethargic, slovenly, and villainous tenant of a house. He lives as a parasite on his very young son who is forced to beg and earn food for the whole family. A tense situation develops but the conclusion is tame and disappointing. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The author displays now and again great skill in portraying character. Gangavva, for example, is depicted as a lovely character embodying graceful woman-hood and some of the details set down add a touch of convincing realism, though occasionally, somewhat heavy and verbose patches by way of description impede the smooth flow of narration. Some of the stories are ill-finished and seem to be made up in haste. The sentimentality of stories like &quot;Vanabhojana,&quot; where tears are far too common, gives evidence of early and amateurish effort.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In &quot;Rev. Dr. Rangas&quot; we have a fine story with an excellent finish. It has a worthy message hidden in it. If abounds in pathos as well magnanimity of character.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In &quot;Sahitya Sarvabhouma&quot; people celebrate the memory of a dead poet (whose widow goes a-begging in the streets) by delivering grandiloquent speeches on his poetic talents. The satire is somewhat thick-laid.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The author wields a facile pen, though one wishes that more care had been exercised in the choice of expressions. Familiar expression distorted to convey an unusual meaning, wrong compounding and archaic formations (for merely euphonic purposes) are some of the defects that one should see entirely avoided.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the whole we have a readable book and some really interesting stories well-told in this collection.</P>

Would he be like a fish out of water and cut a sorry figure in all probability?
Such questions seem idle now since Kaavyakantha Vaasistha Ganapati Muni, known

Surra Ganapati Sastry popularly known as Vaasistha Ganapati Muni alias Naayana,
was born in 1878 at his maternal uncle’s house in Logeesa Agrahaaram in the
present Srikakulam District of Andhra Pradesh. He came of a learned family well-known
for its traditional learning and worship of the Divine as Mother (Sri Vidya).
His mother Suramma believed him to be a gift of the Sun God, Surya, while his
father, Narasimha Sastry held that his son was an incarnation of the Elephant
God, Ganapati, whom he had seen in a vision at Kaasi, coming out of the idol in
the temple of Dunthi Vinaayaka to sit on his lap for a moment and then
disappear. Naayana himself believed to the end of his life that he was an
Avatar of Ganapati, Bhagavan<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Ramana
Maharshi, his master, being an Avatar of his brother Skanda. Ganapati believed
that he descended to the earth in order to fulfil a particular divine mission.
The mission was to free India from foreign yoke and rebuild it on the prestine
principles of the ancient Veda which upholds equality of sexes and social
justice. He dedicated his life for the upliftment of the unprivileged and
under-privileged like the Harijans, serving them both by precept and practise.
To him, Mahatma Gandhi was an Avatar or Maitreya. Engaged, like him, in the
divine mission of national liberation and regeneration. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
spent his early years mostly at his father’s in Kalavarayi Agraharam, a small
village near Bobbili in the present Srikakulam District Andhra Pradesh. He
derived much of his traditional learning from his father and his paternal
uncle, Prakasa Sastry. He was schooled at the <i>paathasoalaas </i>in Bobbili
and Salur. His schooling<i> </i>was but formal. His amazing <i>encyclopaedic </i>range
of knowledge and reconcile erudition for which he was most famous came to him
partly by revelation through his Tapasya and partly by his own desultory
studies. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

a child, he was always active and agile, though his physical health was
woefully poor. It seems he made a mark not only as a sportsman but also as a marksman.
He was a prodigy who mastered all important classics of<i> </i>Sanskrit before
he was fourteen. What is more interesting is that he even discovered and
perfected his own method of calculation in astrology at the tender age of ten.
The method has now been published under the title <i>Ganaka Kanthaabharanam</i>.
Though he began to write regular verses at the age of ten, he did not take care
to preserve any or his early compositions. He was in the habit of destroying
his verses because, very often. He compared them with those of Kaalidaasa,
Bhavabhuti, Bhaaravi and Maagha and found them wanting. On account of this
peculiar habit of striving for almost impossible perfection and consequent
destruction of poems when they fell short of the ideal, the juvenile works of Ganapati
Muni are lost to us. A few occasional verses and two little <i>Khandakaayaas
Paandava Dhaartaraastra Sambhavam </i>and <i>Sukanyaa Dasra Samvaadam, </i>examples
of his early extempore poetry, are all that we have today coming from his early
boyhood days. They are enough to give us a glimpse of the mighty poet and seer
blest that he became in course of time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Though
he became a guru of his gurus at tender age, though his reputation for
predicting the future accurately was very high, though his intellectual precocity
was universally recognized to be extraordinary, Ganapati was very much ill at
ease because the promise of<i> </i>his avatarhood was not fulfilled. There was
no manifestation of the Divine in him as yet. He thought deeply of it and
decided that he should meditate and practise penance as ancient Vedic Rishis
had done for realizing God in their own selves. His rather had already
initiated him into the mysteries of Mantrasaastra and he had daily been
chanting Mantras like Panchaakshari, Medhadakshinaa murty, Naaraayanaastaakahari,
Sauraastakshari, Bala, Maatangi, Bhuvaneswari, Shodasi in all sincerity and
devotion as enjoined by the Saastras. He was seriously thinking of<i> </i>leaving
his home in search of suitable places for worship and meditation when his
father proposed that he should marry. Ganapati hesitated for a while, thinking
that marriage would be an insuperable obstacle in the path of his spiritual
progress and self-realization. Ultimately, he concluded that it was possible to
achieve a harmony between the temporal and spiritual values and interests, and
that celibacy and renunciation were not at all necessary for self-realization
in the Hindu scheme of life. Soon he got married. The philosophy of reconciling
the apparently contrary facts and values of life and learning remained at the
very core of Ganapati Muni’s life and thought. He alone held the key to the
mysterious inner harmony which lent a splendour to his life and puzzled his
critics making them blind to his real achievement which is Life Divine on this
‘too, too, solid earth.’ <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the course of his peregrinations Ganapati visited pilgrim centres like Naasik,
Banaaras, Kaanpur, Bhuvaneshwar, Mahendragiri and practised severest
austerities described in our Puraanas and Saastras. His Tapas, indeed, was glorious.
He had certain mystic experiences at these places and sometimes held communion
with gods and goddesses. Notable among such experiences is his communion with
the Mother at Bhuvaneshwar, when the Divine Mother administered him a cup of
milk-rice-sugar preparation called <i>paayasam. <o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

he was at Mandasaa in 1901, he came to learn that the famous university of
Sanskrit at Navadweep in Bengal had invited scholars and poets of India to
prove their mettle in the court to be held under the formidable presidentship
of Ambica Dutta. Ganapati Sastry was barely twenty-two and yet he had the
audacity to take the gauntlet. In the great battle of poetry and poetics, of
skills of commentary and elucidation, of bright banter and bitter satire that
followed, Ganapati Sastry came out in flying colours. Nineteen scholars of
universal renown, including Ambica Dutta, a betenoire of Ganapati Sastry.
signed the certificate of merit and blessed him with the title <i>Kaavyakantha,
</i>meaning ‘One whose speech is poetry,’ which since then had replaced his
original surname Ayyalasomayaajula. The world knows him only as <i>Kaavyakantha
</i>today. With the resounding victory at Navadweep, the whole literary world
of Sanskrit lay at his feet. <i>Kaavyakantha </i>became a name to conjure with.

Sastry basked in the glory of his poetry for a couple of years. His incredible
performances of <i>Astaavadhaana </i>and his uncanny skill in the game of chess
became legendary. Surely, his achievements were of no mean order. And yet he
was restless. Somewhere in the dark recesses of his heart, he had a lurking
feeling that he had not yet attained the highest state of bliss and godhood. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

1907, Ganapati Sastry was at Arunachalam, discoursing on the Upanishads and the
ten Mahaavidyaas when, all on a sudden, it occurred to him that the Braahmana
Swamy in the cave of Skanda, who had been practising severe austerities for
many years past, giving up speech altogether, might be of help to him. In a
flush he realized that he was in need of a guru–a Master–and the Braahmana
Swamy might be his guru. The historic meeting of the two mighty minds is a
red-letter event in the history of mankind itself. Ganapayi Muni discovered
Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi who besides being his spiritual brother and mentor,
proved himself, later on beacon to the entire world. Here is a description of
the discovery by an authentic disciple of the Bhagavan.<sup> 2</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the heat of the afternoon sun he climbed the hill to Virupaksha cave. The Swami
was sitting alone on the veranda or the cave. Sastri fell on his face before
him and clasped his feet with outstretched hands. In a voice quivering with
emotion he said: “All that has to be read, I have read; even Vedaanta Sastra I
have fully understood; I have performed Japa (invocation) to my heart’s content:
yet have I not up to this time understood what Tapas is. Therefore I have
sought refuge at your feet. Pray enlighten me as to the nature of Tapas.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

thousand verses in praise of Shiva,) <i>Indraani Saptasati </i>(Seven hundred
verses in praise of Indraani), countless Stotras and Sutras. At Padaiveedu he
had the Veda revealed to him through his disciple Daivaraata. At about the same
time, he experienced the presence of the Divine Mother Renuka and Her
celebrated son Parasuraama. With the exception of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa he is

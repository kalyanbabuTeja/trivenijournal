style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
more than sixteen years of playing truant to <i>Triveni, </i>I return to it as
its Joint Editor. I keep wishing I had not spent so many years so apart from <i>Triveni.
</i>I cannot say that these sixteen years odd were either uneventful or
unpleasant to me. They are crammed with </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>fine memories of fine
people in many spheres of life. The most remembered incidents of my home life
belong to this period. It was my good fortune during these years to have
watched at work, and to have worked with, many of the leaders of the legal
profession in </span><st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>.
The unmatched among them was the late Sri <span class=SpellE>Alladi</span>
Krishnaswami <span class=SpellE>Iyer</span>, to whose wisdom and guidance I
owe, a great deal even for what he taught me in but the few cases in which he
led me at the bar. I had also the pleasant experience during this period to
belong to a legislative body to which also belonged the provoking personality
of Sri C. <span class=GramE>Rajagopalachari,</span> the working of whose
sizzling brain it always is a perfect delight to watch. During these same years
I had close political association for a time with Sri T. <span class=SpellE>Prakasam</span>
whom, in spite of initial prejudice, I grew deeply to love and <span
class=SpellE>honour</span>, for he combined legendary <span class=SpellE>valour</span>
and sacrifice and a rugged beauty of character such as have no parallel in the
South of India, and his <span class=GramE>passion</span> for the progress of
the common folk of Andhra was spontaneous and abundant. I cannot honestly rate
my own experience or achievement in any walk of life as worth being mentioned.
But, I admit, even so, that, during all the years of truancy to <i>Triveni, </i>I
had more luck in life than I deserved. There are many regrets too across the
past, and, as I said, there are few things which cause me more regret than that
so large a portion of my life should have been lived away from <i>Triveni </i>and
from what it always meant to me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

am not generally inclined to be personal in what I<i> </i>write for the public,
but I intend to make an exception this once. And deliberately, because I treat
this occasion as one when, in my humble individual capacity, I appeal for
sympathy and help to all friends who love <i>Triveni </i>and wish it to survive
as a vehicle of culture and progress. I do not here appeal for money. Money is<i>
</i>needed for the journal: but money should come to it like the gentle rain
from heaven, blessing him that gives and him that takes. I am not one of those
who can believe that a journal can survive on the strength of some intangible
quality without a group of brilliant writers to fill its pages or a mass of
eager readers to pore through them. No journal lives without a real purpose to
fulfill and without an effective circulation to support it. I, therefore, seek
a far deeper sympathy. I seek the fellowship of those who can write with
authority and grace on all subjects that should be dear to <i>Triveni. </i>I
seek the good will of those who can spread the faith of <i>Triveni </i>among
the cultured and the educated, here and abroad.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

remember with pride the day I first met K. Ramakotiswara Rau nearly twenty-nine
years ago. I was still a student of the <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Presidency</st1:PlaceName>
<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">College</st1:PlaceType> in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City>. In those days I wrote many verses in
English, but at the same time I suffered from a sense of guilt that I was
employing an alien medium for a literary purpose. I found that Sri
Ramakotiswara Rau was publishing poems in the <i>Triveni, </i>which were
originally written in the English language by Indian writers. In a letter to
him, I remember, I questioned the propriety of his publishing them in his
journal. I ventured to suggest that such verses could not be treated as a true
phase of the Indian renaissance in literature. Sri Ramakotiswara Rau replied to
me immediately. As far as I can recollect, he justified himself as Editor by
stating that at least some part of the Indian effort in English versification
belonged to the desirable literary awakening in the country, and that he was
not prepared to rule it out of his journal altogether. He added, in his reply,
that he was eager to meet me in order to discuss the subject further. And he
came to my house accompanied by a common friend. I was thrilled to meet him. We
discussed. We did not quite convince each other. The foundation of our lasting
friendship was, however, laid. From that day he was dear to me like a member of
the family. I had my first glimpse of what an enlightened and cultured editor
should be in his contacts with those who thought and wrote and worked for his
journal. I felt moved by his beautiful simplicity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
have no doubt in my mind that, if money and time permitted him, Sri
Ramakotiswara Rau would have liked to establish as immediate and complete a
personal contact, as happened with me, in the case of every single individual
among the friends all over India who wrote or worked for the <i>Triveni </i>during
these thirty years. He is by no means devoid of ego, but it is an ego which
draws, nourishes, and helps grow to full stature every young aspirant to fame
in the pages of his journal. Acknowledged authors like Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, </span><span

<span class=SpellE>Masti</span> <span class=SpellE>Venkatesa</span> <span

class=SpellE>Baldoon</span> <span class=SpellE>Dhingra</span> and Sri P. R. <span
class=SpellE>Ramachandra</span> Rao in their early efforts of self-expression,
found equal welcome in his hospitable </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>volumes. The younger
ones achieved their fulfillment as writers, in the unreserved and unstinted
appreciation of ability and talent with which he greeted their productions. I
cannot still forget the occasion on which in 1935 or 1936 he read my article in
manuscript on <i>The Logic of Linguistic Provinces, </i>and encouraged me to
write more often. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There was always a sizeable group of young
writers round Sri Ramakotiswara Rau in the <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address
 w:st="on">Armenian Street</st1:address></st1:Street> days of the <i>Triveni </i>in
<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City>. He was
always eager to recognize and seek out and establish talent. Without him,
today, many well-known names in Indian <span class=GramE>journalism,</span> and
among the Indian literatures might, not have been known at all Bengal and <st1:place
w:st="on">Maharashtra</st1:place> and Karnatak are as dear to him as his native
soil in Andhra Pradesh. A great story-teller of <span class=SpellE>Guzerat</span>
like Sri K. M. <span class=SpellE>Munshi</span> or a great poet of <span
class=SpellE>Malabar</span> like Sri <span class=SpellE>Vallathol</span> evokes
as much joy and enthusiasm in him as the Tamil and Telugu writers of nearer
reach. He is happier in <st1:City w:st="on">Bangalore</st1:City> among friends
like Sri D. V. <span class=SpellE>Gundappa</span> and Sri <span class=SpellE>Nittoor</span>
Srinivasa Rau than in <span class=SpellE>Narasaraopet</span> or Masulipatam or
even <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City>. He
is untouched by linguistic and regional prejudices or partialities. The
progress of Indian literature, of Indian art and of Indian culture is his only
passion in life. That mission is the <i>Triveni. </i>And he has given his all,
ungrudgingly, to it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is a great privilege to work with such a man for such a journal. But it is also
a heavy responsibility. I pleaded with Sri Ramakotiswara Rau that he should
wait and choose a more worthy colleague. One like Sri K. Iswara Dutt or Sri M. <span
class=SpellE>Chalapathi</span> Rau, more able, more experienced and more fit to
fill the role of an editor, should have been persuaded to step in. This,
somehow, could not be brought about. The co-operation of men like these and the
co-operation of <span class=GramE>those</span> whom they, from their stations
in life, could induce to help the <i>Triveni, </i>would help the journal
immensely. And it was the assurance that such co-operation would not be wanting
from them which finally encouraged me to accept the difficult function of editing
this journal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
this point I wish to describe exactly what the <i>Triveni </i>always meant to
me. It meant the first invitation to self-expression. It meant the first
opportunity to think accurately in public and to write with precision for the
public. It meant association with kindred spirits all over the land. It meant
the <span class=SpellE>realisation</span> that the literary and the artistic
mind, anywhere in this vast country of ours, was one entire and beautiful
substance: with many <span class=SpellE>colours</span>, many forms, many tunes
and many raptures. It meant the knowledge that a man finds his self and
achieves his self not in isolation from others but in identification with
others. It meant a genuine curiosity to study the thoughts and the literatures
of the other linguistic peoples of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. It meant a keen desire to
improve one’s language and literature by seeking contact with other languages
and literatures. It meant watching every phase of the Indian renaissance, and
attempting to harmonize it with what was valid in the past and with what is
necessary for the future. It meant appreciating only what is of intrinsic and
abiding value in a man or in a nation, and just disregarding mere cleverness,
mere glitter and mere success whether in an individual or in a mass. It meant
striving for the betterment of the body, mind and soul of every living human
being. It meant accepting that the material progress, the cultural progress and
the spiritual progress of mankind are not enemies each to each, but go
together. It meant giving of your best to the culture and the progress of the
nation in all its departments of life, and through the nation to all mankind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

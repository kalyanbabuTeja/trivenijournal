the close of the nineteenth century the age of “cheerful yesterdays and
confident tomorrows” draws to a close, and the Western world enters upon a
period of unmitigated confusion and disintegration. It is characterised by a
breakdown in stable behaviour and a loss of form in many arts, with a
corresponding emphasis on the accidental and trivial. The spirit of the age
reflects, in short, a crisis based upon an “internal schism of the soul”, as
Prof. Toynbee calls it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Science continues to march on, splitting atoms and unleashing tremendous
forces. But unfortunately every gain in power over the natural forces has not
been accompanied by corresponding gains self-mastery and self-understanding.
The rise of the machine and the fall of man are the two parts of the same
tragic process, which has laid all the emphasis on the means of life and
forgotten altogether its consummations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is therefore a real fear that this grand fabric of the machine-age will end in
an inevitable smash-up, and that this Faustian civilization, as Spengler
forecasts in his ‘Man and Technics’, one day may lie in fragments, forgotten;
our railways and steamships as dead as the Roman Roads and the Chinese Wall;
our great cities and skyscrapers in ruins like old Memphis and Babylon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
spirit of disillusionment and doubt, this sense of futility strongly colours
the literature of our time. It may be seen in the work of James Joyce, one of
the clearest and most incisive voices of our generation, who brings his
uncompromising intellect to bear upon the dislocations of society and the
diseases of the soul. The moral failure of modern civilization and the decadence
of the 20th century world is no less the theme of Thomas Mann and Marcel
Proust, who, together with Joyce, make the three major representative novelists
of our time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>This new mood perhaps is nowhere so clearly apparent
as in the Utopian efforts that belong to this period. The Utopian form in
literature is as old as Plato and as recent as Aldous Huxley and Philip Orwell,
author of that frightening satire entitled ‘1984’. In between, we have a number
of writers of undisputed talent, like Sir Thomas More, Francis Bacon, Samuel
Butler, William Morris, Edward Bellamy, and H.G. Wells. It is not our present
purpose to trace the slow evolution of the Utopian tradition, but the reader’s
attention is invited to one striking contrast between the Utopias, old and new.
In the older Utopias there is generally a note of optimism and faith in the
renewal and regeneration of mankind, white in the latter, there is an
unmistakable note of despair, which sometimes becomes a shriek of agony.
Writing in 1887, Bellamy could still confidently assert that “fifty years of
Europe were better than a cycle of Cathay”. But writing in the inter-war period
Huxley, in his ‘Brave New World’ of 1932, bitterly satirises the idea of a
scientific Utopia, in which we find everything thoroughly planned, bottled and
frightful, and from which all emotion, poetry and beauty are sterilised and
eliminated. Then with the Second World War the pendulum swings even more
violently from calm confidence or bitter satire to sudden panic, as may be seen
from Huxley’s ‘Ape and Essence’, or Orwell’s ‘1984’, in which he envisages the
British civilization as it might be 35 years hence, under the dictatorship of
Big Brother, who, with his Thought-Police and Child-Spies, establishes a
totalitarian State in which there is complete regimentation of thought and
action.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>All this represents a sorry state of affairs, a
state of moral vacuum in which humanity cannot continue long. It must struggle
its way back and out into fresh air, where the primal duties shine like stars
above, and the charities that soothe and comfort and bless lie about the feet
of man like flowers. Sooner or late man was sure to turn from the knowledge of
the material world, vast and various as it might be, to a knowledge of the
Spirit, which alone could lend an ultimate meaning even to the facts of<i> </i>the
material universe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
reaction was inherent in the nature of things and conforms to what Hegel terms
the ‘dialectical Process’. If the older preoccupations in the realm of the
Spirit and the age-old religious affirmations form the ‘thesis’, then Science
with its emphasis on the material universe may be taken to form the
‘anti-thesis’ in the Hegelian sense. The human mind is so constituted, however,
that it does not stop with contradictions, but strives to effect a synthesis,
which includes both, but on a higher level. And so the<i> </i>human mind moves
forward toward new values.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
first step toward this higher synthesis must naturally be of the nature of a
rediscovery of those values which the advancing tide of scientific knowledge
had submerged. Thus we find an earnest quest for spiritual reality, side by
side with scientific researches, for spiritual reality alone could answer to
the deepest longings and the highest aspirations of man. Shaw is one of the notable
adventurers engaged in this quest, and his contribution is the discovery of the
significance<i> </i>of the Life Force and Life’s incessant aspiration to higher
organization, wider, deeper and intenser self-consciousness and clearer
self-understanding. This belief in what he terms the ‘evolutionary appetite’,
which is a kind of divine aspiration towards perfection, is the philosophic
basis of most of his plays. It inspires ‘Major Barbara’, ‘The Showing-up of
Blanco Posnet’, ‘Man and Superman’, ‘Back to Methuselah’, to mention only a few
of the more striking illustrations of this idea. Wells is another pioneer who
has carried on vigorous researches into the realm of reality. He does not, of
course, discover the spiritual idea in the traditional sense, but his studies
lead to deep insight into the social values inherent in Science and History, of
which a convincing and lucid statement may be found in his ‘Outline of
History’, ‘The Science of Life’, and ‘Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind’.
These are his works on a grand scale, and they reveal him as an instinctive
believer in the Biblical dictum that Knowledge delivers. It is this faith that
inspires his idea of the ‘open conspiracy’ for a better world:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

we turn to Conrad, we find that to him fiction is history, human history, or it
is nothing. And it is significant that the failure and suffering that come to
his central characters, like Almayer, Lord<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

breach of the great human agreement of fidelity, that sense of loyalty of man

Huxley promises to figure ultimately as the most significant novelist of the
contemporary generation, being the most faithful reflector of the spirit of the
age. He has the soul of the poet as well mind of the scientist, and so is best
equipped to deal with an age in which intellect and emotion constantly struggle
for supremacy and await a higher synthesis to establish harmony between them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

‘Crome Yellow’ of 1921 to ‘Time Must Have A Stop’, published in 1945, Huxley is
engaged in a long pilgrimage of ideas, in which he strives to see reality with
every kind of eye at once, with the biologist’s eye, the chemist’s, the
physician’s, the historian’s and the religious </span><span style='font-size:

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Crome
Yellow’ introduces Denis, a youthful Hamlet-like character, with a temperament
like Huxley’s own. It raises the issue whether “fumbling over books and
thinking about God and Devil and all” is really worthwhile, while others, less
sensitive and less susceptible, with faces like battering rams, are kissing the
beautiful women and seem to have the best of life. On the other hand, ‘Time
Must Have a Stop’, coming some 24 years later, is more precise and positive in
its teaching and drives home the lesson that if there is only a million to one
chance to secure our social salvation, that one chance lies in a return to God.
He holds that the only basis for a better social order is a shared metaphysic,
which embodies the common insight of all the great religions. The purification
of Sebastian, the hero, and the character of Bruno, the mystic, who remains
uniformly human and lovable in spite of his saintliness and detachment, reflect
the influence of Oriental mysticism </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

change of outlook is gradual and is marked by clear-cut landmarks, like
‘Eyeless in Gaza’ and ‘Ends and Means’. The latter may be deemed to be a
Confession of Faith of the later Huxley. In it he ventures to wonder whether
the flux of time, which we try to arrest, is not after all an illusion, and whether
by force of contemplation, after the manner of Oriental mystics, we might not
merge our transitory selves in the timelessness of reality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

doctrine of detachment, which is central to the highest teaching in Hindu
philosophy, thus colours the work of Huxley. It is further<i> </i>discussed,
and at considerable length, in his ‘Perennial Philosophy’; and we see its
influence steadily growing through his later novels like ‘After Many A Summer’
and ‘Grey Eminence’, until we come to ‘Time Must Have A Stop’.<i><o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

half-a-century, he has produced an enormous output of some 19 novels, 24 plays,
a large number of short stories, in addition to works of travel, and

early work is all in the mood of self-expression. We shall pass over his early
novels and also his plays till we come to his latest novel, ‘The Razor’s Edge’,
which is relevant for our immediate purpose. Though published in 1944, it is
strongly influenced by his trip to India in 1938, during which he meets many
Indian yogis, Swamis, and Fakirs and becomes deeply impressed by Oriental
mysticism. The central character in it is a highly unusual man, Lawrence
Darrell, of whose strange life Maugham feels obliged to give an account. He
finds conventional values unsatisfactory and seeks a new way of life, which
involves the gradual giving up of love, friends, besides seversl conventional
interests. He attains to a final knowledge of reality, a sense of being at one
with the Absolute through the Indian philosophical system of Vedanta. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The role or the Judiciary in our parliamentary
democracy is an unique and crucial one. Parliamentary democracy is ruled by the
people through their representative elected to Parliament. In England,
Parliament is supreme and sovereign. It does not only speak for the people, it
decides for them. Its decisions are final cannot be challenged by any
authority. The Judiciary there accept the laws as passed by Parliament – they
cannot challenge their validity. Their role is comparatively, a subsidiary one
of interpreting the law and giving effect to it. Our Judiciary on the other
hand, plays a major role which in a sense places it above Parliament. It does
not merely interpret the laws passed by it, but it also decides their
constitutionality. In our country the Constitution is Supreme. And the
Judiciary has been designated by the Constitution to keep Parliament within the
bounds of the Constitution. If it oversteps it, the Judiciary can strike down
the law. And there is no appeal from the Judgment of the Supreme Court. Its
judgment becomes the law of the land–unless Parliament acting under its
amending power changes the law as declared by the Supreme Court. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
will be immediately noticed that vast and wide are the powers of the Supreme
Court in this regard. Parliament may pass any law but it is the Supreme Court
which is the ultimate arbiter of its validity. It would be erroneous to say
that this gives a power of veto to the Supreme Court or constitutes it as a
third chamber. The Supreme Court is only acting under the Constitution as
indeed the Legislature or Executive is bound to do. One learned author has gone
to the extent of suggesting that the Supreme Court in exercising its right of
judicial review is, in effect, legislating. I do not agree with this view.
Legislation is quite a different process from the exercise of the judicial
function of considering the constitutionality of a law. The result may be that
the view of the Supreme Court prevails over that of Parliament. But the
Constitution has so willed it and has placed in the hands of the judges a
powerful weapon which can be wielded with consequences of infinite importance,
both for the country and the nation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
American Supreme Court has a similar power and our founding fathers preferred
the American model to the British one with a wisdom and foresight, which,
palticularly today, we can only appreciate and admire. In England, Parliament
is elected by a small country and voters vote in small constituencies which
makes it possible for the candidate and the voters constantly to come in
contact. Parliament there has also inherited the traditional of centuries and
acts with restraint and the party in power never uses its majority to ride
rough-shod over the opposition. Because it is conscious of the fact that the
opposition also represents a section of the people and at the next election, it
may come into power. In our country, the position is quite different. The Congress
from being a national organisation which won us our freedom suddenly became the
party in power with no viable opposition to speak of. Unlimited power is a
dangerous thing, more insidious than a heady wine. Because you can recover from
intoxication caused by alcohol, but the intoxication caused by power may become
a permanent state of alcoholism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Further,
the voters in Britain are literate and educated–here we have millions who are
illiterate and although gifted with practical common sense, can be carried away
by the tub-thumping orator or the millennium<i> </i>promised by<i> </i>the
ideological fanatic. Therefore, without the power of judicial review, we will
be governed not by democracy, but by a one-party Government and that one party
might resolve itself into the dictatorship of a single individual. The most
dangerous dictatorship is one which is baled on democratic process–on the forms
and paraphernalia of democracy–on general elections, on adult suffrage which
ultimately throws up not a real representative Government but a dictator who
masquerades as a democrat representing the people but is really carrying out
his own whims and fancies however illogical they may be and however prejudicial
to the country. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
other function of the Judiciary is the protection of the individual’s rights
against the ever expanding powers of Government. Our Government is tending day
to day to become more and more monolithic. It possess power and patronage in
full and even extreme measure. Any opposition to its policies is either muted
or silenced. The voice of dissent is either not heard or suppressed. This is
really a negation of real democracy. For democracy, postulates dispersal of
power, the freedom to think and write what may be most unpalatable to
Government. The citizen is helpless before such display of gargantuan power.
The only check that the Constitution has provided to this runaway inflation of
power is the Judiciary. It alone can safeguard the fundamental rights of the
citizens. It alone can tell the Government–so far and no further. It alone can
act like the angel with flaming swords guarding the citadel of human rights.
Undoubtedly there has to be a balancing between the needs of society and the
fights of the individual, and our Constitution rightly provides for reasonable
restrictions on the freedoms it has guaranteed to the citizen. But in this
balancing, the scales must tip in favour of the citizen. The state must prove
that there is a clear and present danger which would justify it in depriving
the citizen of his rights. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Under
the first amendment to the American Constitution, the right to freedom of
speech and of the press and of assembly is absolute and cannot be abridged
under any circumstances. That is why it was said that maximum personal freedom
was the touchstone of a mature society. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
is the star in the constitutional constellation by which the Judiciary should
chart its course. Our right to freedom is enshrined in Article 19–the charter
of seven freedoms. It is true that it has been considerably curtailed by<i> </i>the
recent judgment of the Supreme Court enlarging the power of Parliament to amend
the Constitution but one redeeming feature of that judgment is that Parliament
cannot alter the basic structure of the Constltution. If freedom is<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>not the basis of democracy, what is? It is
like the savour of salt without which it is not salt. It is to be hoped that
Parliament will not tamper with the seven freedoms and if it does, the Supreme
Court will strike down such a law as affecting the basic structure of our Constitution.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
may be pointed out that the American Supreme Court during Earle Warren’s Chief
justiceship extended the principle of personal liberty to innumerable questions
that had so far remained untouched. To give a few instances–the tremendous advance
in civil rights, the rights of the accused of being represented by Counsel and
setting its face against conviction, extracted by confessions, the prohibition
against any minority being forced to take part in religious exercise,–even when
it came to salute the national flag; the liberal attitude on obscenity laws on
the ground that a discerning public should be left to judge what is literature
and what is trash except when the case is of obvious and unmitigated
pornography. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
one sense, the Judiciary has a creative role to play. Justice Douglas has gone
to the length of saying that the Judiciary is in a high sense the guardian of
the conscience of the people as well as of the law of the land. The conscience
of the people is not always reflected in legislation. Without doing offence to
the doctrine of Judicial restraint, it can by its judgment awaken the
conscience of the people to the evils in society which are crying out for a
remedy and quicken the rate of progress where social legislation is tardy or
ineffective. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
freedom as embodied is a star of first magnitude in the constitutional
constellation, the Rule of Law is also a star of magnitude if not possessing
the same brilliance as the former. The Rule of Law emerges from Article 14 of
the Constitution which prohibits the state from denying to any person equality
before the law or the equal protection of the laws. Therefore, in the eye of
the Constitution all citizens are equal and have equal rights. No
discrimination is permitted as between citizen and citizen and no citizen is
branded as a second class citizen or suffers from any disqualification because
of his caste, community or sex. Even the lowest of the land can aspire to
become the President of India. This represents the triumph of secularism which
is one of the most important pillars on which the edifice of our Constitution
stands. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
you have also to read in Article 14 the provisions that our country is governed
by laws and not by men. No one, however powerful, can defy or refuse to give
obedience to the Constitution and the laws of the land. In a recent historic
judgment, our Supreme Court laid down that our President is not above the
Constitution. His oath requires him to preserve, protect and defend the
Constitution. The U. S. Supreme Court has equally in Nixon’s case denied
executive immunity to the President from obeying subpoenas legitimately served
upon him. In an earlier case, the U.S. Supreme Court set aside the order of
President Truman to seize the Steel Mills to avert a strike during the Korean
War. Truman relied on the aggregate of his powers as Chief Executive and
Commander-in-Chief. The Court held that the order was not authorised by law.</span><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Rule of Law also requires that law must be administered fairly. The standard of
“fairness” has to be applied to all executive actions. Where rights are taken
away, the Court insists that the party affected must be given notice and should
be heard. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chief
Justice Warren once confessed that when he heard cases affecting the rights of
citizens, the question he always asked himself was “Is it fair?” Our Judges may
well emulate the learned Chief Justice. Legal technicalities must take a second
place before the paramount consideration of fairness. It is at the heart of
equity if not of law and if law is not tempered by equity, then it becomes a
barren soulless ritual, a formality which falls to take into consideration the
injury a decision might cause or fall to promote the remedy which the law
itself intended. One learned author has opined that the judicial function in
representing the Rule of Law is best discharged when the Judge realises that he
is on the Bench to protect the helpless and oppressed and uphold the values of
free thought, free utterance and fairplay. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is a mere truism to say that if the Judiciary, is to be the custodian of<i> </i>the
rights of citizens, it must inspire the confidence of the public. It must be
independent and impartial. It must not call any one its master nor should any
one be allowed to call it its servant. It must assign to the waste-paper-basket
any directions it may receive even from the President or the Prime Minister.
Every Judge before he comes to the Bench has a personal philosophy based on
what Holmes called the inarticulate major premise. He may believe in a certain
ideology. He may believe in communism, socialism or the tenets of the Maha
Sabha or the Muslim League. He must leave all these behind and forget them. The
only scripture he must consult and the only Bible he must revere is the
Constitution. His philosophy must be the philosophy which is to be found in the
preamble of the Constitution. That must be his friend, philosopher and guide,
the light which must illumine his years on the Bench. The Courts are not a
department of Government. They are an authority coordinate with the Legislature
and the Executive. Even Parliament, however wide and vast its powers, can only
function under the Constitution. Even if legislation is passed by an
overwhelming majority and Parliament has expressed its clear intention in no
unequivocal terms, the legislation can be tested on the anvil of judicial
review and if it falls the test, Parliament must submit to the decision of the
Court. It is a mistake to call this a confrontation between Parliament and the
Judiciary. Each is discharging its duty assigned to it by the Constitution. If
we have faith in our Constitution, we should call it a collaboration between
two coordinate authorities rather than confrontation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Judiciary down the years has enjoyed a reputation second to none in the
judicial world. We have produced Judges of great eminence, of great learning,
of great humanity who have enriched the pages of the Law Reports. Their
independence and impartiality has never been doubted or suspected. Like a clap
of thunder in a clear night, the atmosphere has changed. For the first time in
the history of judicial administration of our country, Government has publicly
and officially proclaimed a policy which if given effect to, will destroy the
independence of the Judiciary and make it not impartial, but partisan, and
render the judges henchmen of those in authority. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

do not want to go into the question of the supersession of the three judges of
the Supreme Court in any detail. The facts are well-known and the matter has been
debated from a hundred platforms and the action of Government has been
universally condemned–except by those who have eyes and will not see and ears
and will not hear or by those who are committed body and soul to Government or
by those who have gained or hope to gain by this policy of Government. But
human memory is notoriously short and it is necessary to recapitulate briefly
the highlights of this sorry and sordid episode. Chief justice Sikri’s term of
office was coming to an end and he was never consulted about his proposed
successor. He came to know when the name was announced on the radio like any
other man in the street. The judges superseded were also never informed. So
important an event as the appointment of the Chief Justice of India was manipulated
and presented as a <i>fait accompli </i>in the utmost secrecy, so that there
should be no time for the Bar or the public to protest against so egregious an
action. A similar action was intended at the time of Mr. justice Shah, but it
was foiled because the Bar and the Bench protested strongly when it came to
know about it. The convention of appointing the seniormost Judge to succeed as
Chief Justice never departed from in the past was callously disregarded without
any justification although </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>he senior-most judge
was respected by the Bar as one of the ablest incumbents of the Bench. The
three judges superseded had all voted against the Government in the well-known
Fundamental Rights case to which Government attached the greatest importance
and treated it as a prestigious issue. The mere narration of these facts is
sufficient to satisfy any impartial Judge that what happened was a calculated
and preconceived plot on the part of Government to undermine if not destroy the
independence of the Judiciary. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

official explanation on the floor of Lok Sabha when there was a pained and
shocked outcry from Bars all over India and from the general and thinking
public, made matters worse. Government claimed an absolute right to appoint
such Judge as they thought proper, and they left no doubt as to who they
thought were proper Judges. A Judge must be forward looking; a Judge must be
conscious of any change of wind; he must be in tune with the Congress policy.
It need hardly be said that if this was going to be the policy in future for
the appointment of Judges, every Judge who thought more of his preferment and
promotion than his Judicial reputation or honest, of purpose would try to give
satisfaction to Government by looking forward as far as he could from his chair
on the Bench–the clearer the vision the greater the prospects. He would study

deadly blow had been dealt at the one institution in India which had refused to
conform to Government’s views, which time and again had told Government in no

protected the rights of citizens against the ever-increasing inroads of
Government and Government-controlled Parliament, upon a free society which is
another name for democracy in contradistinction to a captive and totalitarian
society. But the Bar reacted gloriously. It was their finest hour and
Government was made to realise that public opinion will not tolerate the
destruction of one of the most important pillars of the Constitution. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

important matter which requires an immediate amendment of the Constitution is
to place the Judge in the same position as the Auditor-General. The latter
cannot hold any office under the Government or under the Government of any
State after retirement. This is a salutary provision to ensure the utmost
impartiality and integrity in an office of high responsibility. Does a Judge
hold an office which is less responsible and which calls for less independence
or impartiality? It is sad to see the number of Judges who pay Court to
Ministers to get appointed to some Tribunal after retirement–and it is sadder
to see how many Tribunals are manned by ex-Judges. There is one Judge I know of
who has never ceased to be in charge of a Tribunal of some sort or another ever
since his retirement which was a very long time ago. Only the cruel and relentless
hand of death can remove him from a Tribunal. The consequences of this policy
of Government have been highly prejudicial to the fair name of the Judiciary.
Short time before retirement, every judgment of a Judge, however honest,
becomes suspect. If it is in favour of Government, and rightly so, he is
accused of pleasing those who have patronage to bestow. And some Judges I know
go out of their way to decide against Government in order to assert their
independence, which is equally unfortunate. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

necessary, fill up his temporary vacancy by a fresh appointment. The other
advantage of this solution will be that it would be the Chief Justice who would
recommend the Judge for the Tribunal. Today, it is the Government who bestow
favours upon those whom they like or who have given them satisfaction by their
judgments. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Judges to an independent authority. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>One suggestion is that the concurrence of the Chief
Justice should be necessary in the case of every appointment of a Judge of the
High Court or Supreme Court. In the case of appointment of the Chief Justice of
a High Court, the concurrence of the Chief Justice of India should be necessary
and in the case of the appointment of the Chief Justice of India the
concurrence of the retiring Chief Justice should be required. Another
suggestion is the Constitution of a high powered Judicial Council whose
concurrence would have to be sought. The Council should consist or retired
Chief Justices not holding any office of profit under the State. </p>

last question I will deal with is the appointment of<i> ad hoc </i>Judges. The
provision has been made for such appointment to seek a sudden contingency. But
what was intended as a contingency has tended to become a settled practice. The
retiring age of every Judge is known–he cannot hide it as a woman is supposed
to hide hers. Why does not Government make up its mind to fill up a vacancy
long before it occurs, so that the strength of the Court is not reduced even
for a short time? Today, the vacancy is not filled up when it occurs and the
retiring Judge is very often asked to continue as an <i>ad hoc </i>Judge. This
is a pernicious practice and contrary to the spirit of the Constitution. In
effect, it extends the retiring age of a Judge. If a retired Judge continues as
an <i>ad hoc </i>Judge, then he retires not at the point of time fixed by the
Constitution but after an indefinite period determined by the Chief Justice. It
may not be charitable to say so, but it is not far from the truth that
Ministers like candidates for judgeships to pay court to them, to attend their
Darbar, dangle the glittering prize before them to impress them with their
power and authority and finally when a decision has reluctantly to be taken,
appoint the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In conclusion, I must stress the importance of
public opinion as far as the independence of the Judiciary is concerned.
Whoever believes in democracy must believe in the ultimate triumph of public
opinion, if it is strong, united and fearless. If it is the people who have to
govern the country, then the will of the people can only be manifested through
public opinion. Recently, it has toppled (to use an expression which has now
become part of the political vocabulary of our country) the President or the
United States–than whom there is no more powerful person in the world with the
possible exception (and I must mention the exception) of our Prime Minister. If
it can do that it can surely condemn backsliding Judges and see that they
remain on the right track, true to themselves, true to their high office and
loyal to the Constitution. It can also prevent Government from pursuing any
policy or taking any action which will undermine the prestige, the dignity and
independence of the Judges. </p>

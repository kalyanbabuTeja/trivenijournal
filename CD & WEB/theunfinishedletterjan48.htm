handwriting, it is my brother-in-law’s,” said her little brother Gopu throwing
at her, as he entered, a postal cover. She had just then retired for rest after
food.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Parvati got up and took the letter saying, “A
letter for me, and that from your brother-in-law!” Her voice and manner
betrayed surprise. She had never received, these six years since her marriage,
any epistle from her husband. Although, after her first confinement, she stayed
in her parents’ home till the child had completed the first anniversary of his
birth, she had not been favoured with any letter. Now, she had been detained by
her mother so that she should not be left alone, to worry too much with a
tender baby in her arms. No objection had been raised by her husband to her
staying away from him so long. Nor had he written anything to her separately.
So she had continued her stay longer than necessary and had been free from all
cares. Occasionally there used to be correspondence between her husband and her
father, and much of it would be by way of formal enquiries on either side.
Whenever her father read aloud such letters, she showed no particular interest.
Not that her behaviour denoted any disrespect, but her personal embarrassment
and sense of delicacy deprived her of the desire to communicate her thoughts to
others. Perhaps she imagined that people around her might make fun of her
affection and solicitude for a husband so much her senior in age. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Her brother Gopu did not fail to remark jocularly,
as he handed her the envelope, “Has brother-in-law turned youthful all of a
sudden to feel like writing love-letters” Her avidity to peruse the contents of
the letter vanished as her brother’s words fell on her ears. She felt a sense
of confusion coming over her. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Parvati was beautiful. Her physical charms and her
poise seemed to suggest the appropriateness of the name she was given. Slender
like a creeper, and of golden complexion, she easily justified the term ‘a
beauty’ which was enhanced by the curly locks. But, we know, good looks are not
by themselves everything to a person; wealth is what people desire nowadays.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Her father belonged to the middle class of society,
being the head of a large family composed of sons and daughters. His financial
condition had deteriorated owing to the expenses incurred in getting his
daughters married and his sons educated. When he had to search for a proper
bridegroom for his youngest daughter, he was on the verge of exhaustion,
feeling in his heart, “Well, I have another daughter yet to give away in
marriage. And so there seems to be no end to my domestic worries.” About the
same time a cousin of his wife had become a widower and expressed a desire to
have Parvati as his second wife. He was rich and had no children by his first
wife. He was straight in conduct and came of a respectable family. He was
courting marriage again, more to relieve his home of its desolation and
cheerlessness. He was a bit aged. At first, Parvati’s father hesitated slightly
for this reason. But his wife prevailed upon him by her conclusive argument,
“How can you get all that you require!” Added to this was his own feeling of
weariness, which finally made him yield.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Was Parvati agreeable to the proposal? Who cared to
know her mind? Till recently it was not the custom in Hindu households to
consult daughters regarding the choice of their husbands. The parents were
supposed to arrange matches for their daughters which would ensure their
ultimate good. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>In this particular instance the whole village had
been discussing the un-wisdom of the parents in keeping a grown-up daughter
without marriage. People seemed to have no other topic of discussion. Parvati’s
mother heaved a sigh of relief the moment her daughter’s marriage was decided
upon. Her father also breathed freely. “God has been pleased to send Parvati this
choice. Everything augurs well. Otherwise, I should be wearing out my foot in
endless journeys. Further, where is one to get the money?” By fixing up the
marriage he thought he would be relieved of further expense on trains and
travels. Moreover, he had now the approval of his wife, which added to his own
satisfaction. Only Parvati had no share in that smug feeling that all was well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>But was she against it?. She was not. No special
felicity sprouted in her heart. “Father wishes it; mother approves of it.
Brothers and sisters are not opposed to it. So I shall also be agreeable to
it,” thought she, in private. Rather, she had forced herself to think in that
strain. Her beauty, her youth, her capacity for love, all seemed to have no
existence before that way of thinking. None else in her home showed any concern
for them either. Nor did she herself evince any concern for them!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

everything had to be hustled through. The date and the hour were fixed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>On the night previous to the marriage, her elder
sister was dressing up Parvati for the Presentation Ceremony. The fresh silks
and ornaments she wore added a distinct charm to Parvati’s natural attraction.
After giving the finishing touches, her sister gazed for a moment at Parvati.
She expanded as she felt that Parvati’s loveliness did not suffer by comparison
with anyone; so she burst out: “Well, considering our dear Parvati’s beauty,
she should not have been so oddly matched. She could have been spared the ignominy
of becoming a second wife.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Parvati took to heart these words of her sister.
She realised for the first time how incongruous seemed one’s possession of good
looks in association with a second marriage. Looks are certainly enviable. But
the stigma of becoming a second wife seemed inerasable. The very idea was a
design to sacrifice beauty and youth at the altar of worldly considerations.
She was exercised considerably in mind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>She was to be a second wife–did she not know of it
previously? She was well acquainted with that fact, no doubt. She also knew
that her husband was middle aged. She had not felt any of those points as
objectionable. What if she became a second wife? Was not one of her own elder
sisters given in marriage in the same way? She had never complained of
unhappiness. Again, she had heard elderly women dinning into her mother’s ears
how second wives always fared well and gained influence and position in their
new homes. She therefore entertained no grievance at all on that score.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Still, what her sister had uttered that night must
have come from the depths of her heart. Those words upset her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The bridegroom, according to custom, never goes to
the bride’s place on the night of the Presentation Ceremony. Therefore Parvati
was given no opportunity of knowing how her husband looked, before actually
facing him the next morning when garlands were exchanged between the pair. As
soon as she saw him, her heart sank within her. For, there was nothing in his
looks to attract her. Moreover he was almost bald of head. He was developing a
paunch too. These gave him a more aged look. Nevertheless there was a touch of
dignity in his deportment, though Parvati did not even for a moment deem it as
compensating for his other defects. Naturally her disappointment was great.
Every time she peeped through the corner of her eyes at him, her heart began to
echo the sentiments of her elder sister. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>As soon as the <i>tali </i>of saffron and gold was
tied round her neck, the couple received the blessings of every one of the elders
present. When the bridegroom tried to prostrate before Parvati’s sister’s
husband, the latter reminded him of his own comparative youthfulness and
prevented the bridegroom from doing obeisance. Those words, uttered casually,
probed the sore spot in Parvati’s heart. True, her sister was older than
herself. But her sister’s husband was much younger than her own husband. Well,
that reminded her how much older her husband should be than herself! As she was
calculating the difference in years between them, her head reeled. If her
sister had, by her remarks, touched her sensitiveness, she became only too
prone to take to heart her sister’s husband’s unwitting observations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>With downcast looks, therefore, Parvati entered the
inner apartments to remove the garlands on her person. One of her aunts
standing near by began to pity her lot thus: “Poor girl, how unfortunate! It
can’t be helped.” Another dame of greater age and experience shouted in order
to suppress this unseemly sympathy: “It isn’t a great misfortune, really! You
will find Parvati more lucky than the rest.” But Parvati in truth retained her
aunt’s words in her memory and hardly remembered the older lady’s attempts to
erase them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Her sorrow could not be restrained. Her sadness,
which was already full to the brim, coursed down in a stream of tears. She was
partly unhappy about her own state of mind. She was hurt as well, that she was
becoming the target of everyone’s fun and adverse comment. On top of it all,
was her own sense of humiliation and anger rising towards all those who spoke
so unfeelingly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Thus within the brief span of two days, three such
instances wiped out all trace of satisfaction in her heart. They tended to
remove any feeling of tenderness she possessed. They brought in, on the other
hand, a certain amount of hardness and reserve. The world, to her, seemed a
mere hunting ground for the ambitious. Her own father came in for a good share
of her resentment. She refused to be a party to the many little items of fun
and frolic usual in Hindu marriages. She feared that such occasions would only
provide more opportunities for her misfortunes getting advertised. Her husband
too discouraged all customary merry-making. Parvati felt grateful to him for
this kindness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

always busy about a hundred little things. Her sisters were indifferent, as
their own domestic duties hardly left them time for taking more interest in

letter was quite unexpected. Yet there was no flutter of approaching happiness

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Parvati had read many romances. Her only pastime
during intervals of domestic work in her husband’s home was to read modern
novels. Words of love were not new to her. But what could they avail her now1
She felt no necessity for any of them. She began her letter in a formal manner.
Her only satisfaction was that at least a reply to her husband was on its way
to reassertion. She tried to express her new-born sense of pride in him, as she
had not felt bold enough hitherto to express it to him in person.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Half the letter had not been written, when there
was a knock on the outer door. “Who is it? Find out” uttered her father from
inside, disturbed in his slumber. She put her letter down and started towards
the door. It was a telegraph peon. “Is this Mr. Jagadisa Aiyar’s residence?”
asked he, once again looking at the address on the envelope of the telegram.
Parvati received it after duly signing the receipt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The peon had left. Some stray dogs in the street
chased him for some distance, startled by his cycle bell. The neighbours, some
of them, also got up to see what the noise indicated, and, finding some
telegram delivered at Jagadisa Aiyar’s, waited to know the news.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Parvati handed it to her father. Somehow her heart
was not calm. Maybe her sister-in-law at Bezwada had been delivered of a child.
There could be other items of news as well. The telegraph peon was not a rarity
either in the village, as a number of college girls and boys had come there
-during the holidays to be with their parents. Still a telegram excited her a
bit; and before her father could peruse it fully, she was on the verge of
despair. Just as she had anticipated, bad news awaited her. Her father read
aloud the contents: “Kailasam seriously ill; consciousness lost; start
immediately.” Parvati was stunned by the news. Her mother came from within and
began bewailing: “We do not know what is in store for her. May God spare her,
at least the auspiciousness of a married woman!” The news spread all around.
The neighbours tried to assuage their tears with the words: “Maybe, there is no
real cause for so much anxiety.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

for the village. With her things got mixed up her unfinished letter. As she
went, she nursed the hope that he might have a chance to see it after

consciousness. The doctor from the Government Hospital of the neighbouring town
had pronounced the case serious and said: “The patient cannot be expected to
breathe much longer.” For he had diagnosed the case as one of septic-poisoning,
and gave it as his opinion that neglect at the initial stages had brought about
this dire consequence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

apartment. He was breathing feebly. His agents and neighbours were crowding
round his bed. As soon as they noticed Parvati and her parents, they made way
for them. Parvati’s father bent down to the patient’s ear and loudly called him
by his name. There was no response. Save for the lingering breath in the body,
there was hardly anything to indicate his contact with the world of the living.
Parvati’s father could not contain himself any longer and loudly bemoaned his
daughter’s lot. Parvati too felt like crying aloud.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>She had but recently resolved to convey to her
husband, her feelings of genuine regard for him. And now, he was leaving her
with no knowledge of her feelings. She was crushed under the weight of
unbearable grief. The child Balachandran, bewildered at seeing so many dolorous
faces, neared the bed and called in babbling tones, ‘Father, father!’ Someone
nearby caught him up, and kept him from approaching the father. The patient’s
chest shook violently as if in answer to the child’s voice. A moment later he
opened his eyes and gazed wildly, only to close them for the last time. He left
the world without knowing that his dear child and its mother were near him at
the last moment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

her to fall on the corpse and wail aloud. But how was she to extricate herself
from the grip of habitual self-suppression and exhibit her grief in the
presence of so many? That habit of utter restraint would not leave her even
then. What did it matter to her now, what anyone thought of her? Her husband,
her own Balachandran’s father, had gone for ever. Poor boy! He had lost a
father’s love while so tender. Her pathetic situation urged her to cry herself
out. But she did nothing of the kind. Her self-immolation all these years had
disabled her from behaving as she wished to. She could only stand petrified in
her place and shed silent tears.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

father enquired of her husband’s agents why they had not informed him of their
master’s serious condition in time. Their answer, given in submissive tones,
was that till the previous day there was nothing in his condition to cause
alarm, that he was waiting to write a reply to his father-in-law’s letter, that
he was even expecting some letter to arrive. But that night, there was a sudden
turn for the worse. As soon as the change was noticed they had sent the telegram.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

extinguished much earlier.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

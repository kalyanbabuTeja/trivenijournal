dream of Subrahmanya Bharati, the poet of renascent India, has already begun
showing signs of fulfillment. He reiterated, in more than one song expressive
of the upsurge of nationalism, the urgent need for self-expression in the
mother-tongue. He saw with clear vision the hour of dawn and deliverance for
the country in all spheres of activity, apart from the political which was the
most obsessing factor at the time when he sang. Today at the threshold of an
era of momentous changes and revival, we have nothing but admiration for the
poet at the way he foresaw all this. We bow in reverence to the immense power
of His pen which unfurled futurity before our eyes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
national movement of the last few decades has had to use the language of the
people more and more for their regeneration and education. An atmosphere of
national pride and love of things Indian has been generated. The more sober
minds are going back to the literature and religion of the past. They look on
them with discernment and interpret them in a new light. They discover a fresh
meaning and attraction in our culture and tradition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

doubt it is an irrefutable fact that still in our education English claims a
larger share of attention. Inheriting a system, we still feel unable to imagine
a time when we can carryon without using the English language for our
administrative purposes. But signs are everywhere evident to predict that the
position will change, as it has been increasingly felt that all this is not
quite sound. An awakening has already come of which the good results are
visible, though too rapid and premature an acceleration of change may lead to
inadequacy to meet all modern demands of communication of thought. Even the
most sanguine of Tamil enthusiasts will have to concede that Tamil vocabulary
and diction, like those of many sister languages, do not as yet possess
adequate number of terms of art in order to facilitate conveyance of modern
ideas in it. The task now awaits the country of moulding the renascent culture,
combining the best of the heritage of the past and the best that has been
imbibed from our contact with Western </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>thought and

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
estimate the present pace of advance in Tamil literature, we may have to get a
peep into the recent past, say a century at the least. The latter half of the
nineteenth century, though not fertile in poetic output, was not totally devoid
of some significant writing. Gopala Krishna Bharati, the precursor of , our own
Bharati, was a poet of acknowledged authenticity. Being the celebrated author
of the operatic masterpiece ‘Nandan Charitram’, he is still a wonder to many a
muse-worshipper, how he could introduce so much dramatic element and musical
quality and devotion in a piece of no considerable length. People who have
listened to this marvel of literary invention have been transported to realms
of rare experience and all-pervading spirituality. Scholars may find flaws in
this work by reason of the colloquialism employed here and there in the
language; but to the pure Rasika, these very things prove delicious and vital
intimations of literature, undreamt of before this god-intoxicated singer
poured out the strains of his melodious art.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
establishment of a settled Government under the foreign rule as well as the
spread of printing in the 19th century led to the emergence of a group of
educated persons with a modern outlook. Therefore, the shaping of the literary
activity also partook of ideas of the West, especially of English literature.
No doubt, here again, all our sister languages of the South were equally under
a debt to this influence. Learned men in Tamil, though trained under the old
system, became none-the-less ardent votaries of the English language, with the
result that they emulated the good features of their masters. The printing and
publishing of classics were started, which naturally made it easy for more
people to study Tamil literature. ‘Sthalapuranas’ or accounts of sacred spots
of pilgrimage began to be compiled and we cannot fail in this context to refer
to the scholar-writer Meenakshi-sundram Pillai, the fountain-source from which
Dr. U. V. Swami</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>natha Aiyar drew much inspiration for his
monumental researches and classical editions of ancient works. Perhaps it may
not be </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>proper to single out names without referring to
two others, Arumuga Navalar and Ramalinga Swamigal, whose personalities in the
perspective of time gain no mean importance for scholarship and mastery of
expression. Navalar was a very learned scholar and writer while Swamigal was a
saintly poet and composer of accredited merit. From the life of
Meenakshisundaram Pillai written by Dr. Swaminatha Aiyar, we are able to gather
an idea of the well-established reputation enjoyed by the former for his numerous
works in Tamil. Other names like that of Damodaram Pillai and Kanagasabhai
Pillai also occur to us in dealing with the latter part of the last and the
earlier portion of the current century. Damodaram Pillai hailed from Jaffna
while the other was bred up in English education, with the result that he
brought to bear his new sense of values on our ancient classics and literature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sundaram
Pillai is yet another name to conjure with along with two others, Poondi
Ranganatha Mudaliar and Vedanayakam </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Pillai of Mayavaram,
the trio making up for all the sterility of the nineties in the fields of
literary writing and musical composition. B. R. Rajam Aiyar, one of the
earliest to come under the spell of Swami Vivekananda when he visited Madras in
1893, surprised the world by his attempt at fiction-writing–almost the first of
its kind in the Tamil Nad. His justly famous ‘Kamalambal Charitram’ bears all
the strength of simplicity of style with a blend of idealism and realism in the
story told, though by its loosely-knit plot and touch of improbabilities it
suffers a bit in its appeal to fastidious critics. Perhaps one may not be far
wrong in ranking it with Goldsmith’s ‘Vicar of Wakefield’ for its easy
unaffected narrative as well as its apparent flaws of contrivance of
situations. ‘Pratapa Mudaliar Charitram’ of Vedanayakam Pillai is something of
a combination of biography and fiction, with an unevenness running throughout
its literary craftsmanship. Still, patches of living portraiture of the times
and individuals make it worthy of even the most advanced of modem writers.
‘Manonmaniyam’ of Sundaram Pillai is a play written at a time when hardly
anything like a drama ever existed in Tamil literature, and its uniqueness is
further vouchsafed by its emphasis on patriotism and love of freedom–themes
that are ever fresh and full of inspiration to generations of readers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Ability
for prodigious research and scholarship of a singularly genuine type were
embodied in Dr. Swaminatha Aiyar, who during his four-score years and more
proved to the world of savants how to the man of earnest labours, even gigantic
obstacles can lose their proportions and size and move away from his path of
duty. In the sphere of editing the classics with precision and ample notes,
perhaps none has equaled him yet, despite better environment for research work
prevailing at the present day. Unsullied integrity alone was responsible for
the fame he achieved, maintaining its hold on both contemporaries and
generations after. His simple prose style amazed readers that such a confirmed
Pundit could write so naturally and without adornment. His reminiscences and
biographical accounts of two of his predecessors in the field of Tamil Letters
are great storehouses of information to us regarding times of comparative
neglect of Tamil. Still they do not strike us by anything that we associate
with biographical art as derived from Western models.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Another
great scholar, Mahavidvan R. Raghava Aiyengar, is a name to reckon with while
we are on the group of scholars in the last half-a-century. He, unlike his
compeers of whom we have spoken, was possessed of a type of scholarship which
derived as much advantage from Sanskrit as from Tamil sources for any of his
theories in the reconstruction of the chronology and history of Tamil
literature. He was therefore even better than others in the matter of deeper
penetration into the classics, though much of what he wrote came in for
controversy at the hands of those who suffered from chauvinistic tendencies. He
was stimulating at times in his interpretations, though his style did not get
over the early influences of pedantry and artificiality of presentation common
to the Pundits. ‘Parikathai’ is his monumental work, being a poem recording the
traditional lore round the figure of the illustrious Pari, and the value of the
book gains considerably by the astonishing fund of information included in the
commentary to it from his own pen. His translation of Kalidasa’s ‘Sakuntalam’,
though it certainly fulfilled a long-felt want of a correct translation of the
great Sanskrit play in Tamil, hardly satisfies scholars and laymen alike
because of its ponderousness of style.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
list of scholars mentioned above neither has exhausted the top-ranking men in
the field nor has indicated the clusters of English-educated ones of a latter
period, like S. Vaiyapuri Pillai, who fortunately is with us doing eminent
service in the direction of removing many of the cobwebs of superstition ant
sentiment enmeshing the so-called theories of unadulterated Dravidian lore and
literature shining in all their isolated splendour. Before I try to<i> </i>indicate
the trends of literary writing of today, let me touch upon the background first
of the change brought about by the incessant flood of nationalism generated by
that huge force for political emancipation–the Congress.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Subrahrnanya
Bharati, the harbinger of a new era for Tamil literature, drank deep of
nationalism from the Congress and its </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ideals. Being a poet
first and foremost, before anything else, he felt the emotional call to serve
his country in the best way he could. Thus his powerful imagination, added to
his cultural upbringing, easily drew from him vibrant lines of exhortation to
his countrymen to live up to the ideals of their forbears, without at the same
time losing the capacity for imbibing the best of modern orientation in many
aspects of our life. His intense spiritual longings lit up his entire outlook
and also permeated his poetry with a glow of ineffable exaltation of spirit. If
he described Panchali in his celebrated poem as dishevelled of locks and
despairing of help from all those around watching her pathetic plight, there
was an implied suggestion of the utterly humiliating circumstances in which
India, his dear land, was then situated under the British yoke. Thus his
patriotism ran equal to his poet fervour in whatever he touched. He was at the
same time not uninfluenced by the traditional objectives of true poetry which
guarantees in no small measure a living religion in the hearts of both the muse
and musician. The imprimatur of his spiritual experience cannot be more
effectively envisaged by us than in the bunch of poems entitled ‘Kannamma’ from
his pen, stirring us with their extraordinary beauty of imagery and
exquisiteness or lyrical charm. But before he could display matured thought and
richer vision he was snatched away by untimely death. His spirit burned with
such a steady light that even his articles or topical value which appeared in
the ‘Swadesamitran’ contained genuine sparks of the fire. His prose too
deserves attention from us of a later period for its engaging vividness and
freedom from affectation. The present day renaissance in Tamil prose owes not </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>a
little to Bharati’s intrepidity in expressing whatever he wrote with directness
and clarity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

tried his skill at fiction too, but with indifferent success. His soul, steeped
in poetry, perhaps could not bring itself down to reeling out long dialogues
and contrive adroit situations which, for the sake of enduring realism, a
writer is<i> </i>forced to adopt in a novel. Or perhaps, had he lived some more
years, he would have demonstrated his originality and power of moving hearts by
means of fiction as well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Bharati was not without fine models before him at that time. Pandit Natesa
Sastri, a writer of novels, indebted to Sanskrit and Tamil alike for
contribution to his distinct style, pleased a generation of much
English-educated individuals whose tastes were trained in the classics of
Dickens and Thackeray. Though originality was not his forte, still Sastri’s
inimitable sketches of domestic scenes, in two of his totally home-made novels,
sprang a surprise upon a world starved for such fine portrayal of intimate
life. A. Madhaviah, a compeer of Sastri, came out with his novels of complete realistic
imagination, betraying no doubt his indebtedness to master-novelists like
Thackeray. His ‘Padmavati-Charitram’ and ‘Vijayamarthandam’ are the results of
a conscious<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>art and a desire to choose
the channel of fiction for spreading new ideals among the youth of the land
with our healthy contacts with the West. Indeed, some others too of the early
fiction-writers have left indelible marks of their receptivity to new thought
and new ways of expression. Translations into Tamil from Bankim Chandra Chatterjee–the
Sir Walter Scott of the Indian literary scene–also spurred on literary minds to
devote themselves more and more to the medium of the novel, though only with
limited success.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thus
the first two decades of the present century saw the rise and growth of a class
of English-educated persons cultivating self- expression with zeal in the
mother-tongue. Despite the first flush of success attending upon their attempts
at modernising literary forms, they did not evince signs of outgrowing alien
influences at their best.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

essay, as an alluring form for the artist to convey his philosophy of outlook,
caught the imagination of some of the promising penmen of the period, though
the full gamut of its usefulness and aim failed to attract them.
Chelvakesavaraya Mudaliar, Vedachalam Adigal and Thiru Vi. Ka (Kalyanasundara
Mudaliar), three of the earliest to adopt the essay as the medium of their
expression to impart to the Tamil-loving people some of their favourite
conceptions regarding life and achievement, impressed themselves sufficiently
on the literary history of the times. Sometimes their well-reasoned articles
came in for discussion among friendly groups with both animation and
understanding. Vedachalam, in his later years known as Marai Malai Adigal, was a
good Sanskrit student, and, despite his deep prejudices against the Aryan
tongue, gave the world a very compact and illuminating appreciation of
Kalidasa’s ‘Sakuntalam’, which certainly can be read with profit by all those
who care for real critical literary appreciation. Text-books on grammar and
dictionaries began to be produced to meet the growing educational needs, as
also works on modern scientific subjects. Lexicographers we have had in the
past like Rottler and Winslow, both of the West, with their deep love of Tamil,
and S. Vaiyapuri Pillai, still with us, with his unusually unbiased outlook and
severe self-examination whenever he has to contribute his point of view<i> </i>upon
controversial topics, as for instance the Age of the Sangam and the date of ‘Tholkappiam’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Creative literature in Tamil should be deemed to
have not had much of a beginning before the Gandhian era of non-cooperation
Movement and its varied reactions on the public mind. Save for a few pioneers
who have been already dealt with briefly, real enthusiasm for creative writing
hardly ever stimulated minds before the thirties of this century. Energetic
discontent was solely responsible for the sudden rich output in the field of
short-stories by many young and spirited youths, requiring the solace of
self-expression in their desire for freedom from repression of some kind or
other. The lamp Bharati lighted in the festival of revival was neither left
untrimmed nor allowed to burn fitfully. We are too near to the period to
estimate correctly its achievement. Yet one thing will be clear, namely, that
the birth of a number of journals and periodicals in the thirties bears witness
to a new throb of life in the production of books and pamphlets in Tamil.
Dailies like ‘Swadesamitran’ had already paved the way for a certain amount of
accurate reportage and news vending. But the real journalistic flair in Tamil
had not been envisaged properly till ‘Ananda Vikatan’ under Kalki made its
appearance on the scene. It was with Kalki’s entry into the field that we come
across journalistic writing containing a combination of directness and
lightness of touch in dealing with problems of national import. Kalki must be
acknowledged as the true architect of Tamil journalism, because he alone gave
it an impetus to take a leading part in the shaping of public opinion on many
vital matters affecting the country. With a pen dipped in humour and irony he
whipped up a sluggish public conscience and inert political thinking into
action. His style refreshingly struck a mean between richness of diction and
commonness of idiom, and made the normal reader feel a familiarity with the
written language as at no other previous period. Added to it was his unique
talent to analyse facts and to argue cogently when espousing any great case. A
rich harvest of appreciation he gained for his unprecedented power to employ
happy turns of expression; and naturally, once he succeeded in capturing Tamil
Nad by his ability for writing, at every step it was assured to him, whether it
was a short or a long story, or whether it was a thousand paged novel or a film
version of a saga of Tamil Nad’s eminent rulers of old.</p>

in his wake there have been many similar attempts at periodical productions,
but of course with much less effective verve or vigour in presentation of
matter. Still we cannot be blind to the great scope these journals gave to
rising talent to win the first laurels in short-story writing. Many young men

study of any of the literatures, Tamil, Sanskrit or English, exhibited marks of
promise and easy self-expression in fictional output. Also due to the

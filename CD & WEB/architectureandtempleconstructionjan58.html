his limbs. It expresses the organic conditions and rhythms of his body that

the functional organisation of enclosed space, vertically and horizontally.
Wood, stone, brick, steel or cement is the appropriate medium for the recording
of immortality of existence, of life and death, of power, achievement and

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Architecture,
as it deals with the raw materials and elemental forces of nature on a big
scale, expresses stability and endurance through geometrical patterns which
appeal to the imagination of the beholder. All great Architecture reveals the
human values of a people in a particular age. One eminent critic says, “It is
of the earthy, cognate in its constitution with the structure of the Universe,
and at the same time it is transcendental revealing more than any other art the
equilibrium of human interests and values, the structure of the human soul.
More than any other art, Architecture, which is an extension and reinforcement
of the repose and tension of the frail human body, enters into, shapes and
moulds the human soul in its poise and rest, excitement and flight.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
subordination of Painting and Sculpture to Architecture, to the contemplative
spirit of man, was established in the Buddhist and Jain temples of Ajanta,
Ellora, Bagh and other cave temples which were suited to solitary meditation
and devotional gatherings. In the same manner the builders of the Gothic
Cathedrals in France filled the walls, pillars and railings with Biblical
stories. The best Architecture of the world has been influenced by religion.
Buddhism through its conception of the oneness of all sentient life and the
worship of varied Buddhas, </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

self-sacrifice, left an indelible impression on the development of ethical
values of humanity. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

of the oneness of cosmic spirit in all forms and manifestations, has taught the
integration of living beings with nature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
ancient days our great Yogis meditated in forests and lived in caves and hence
the cave Architecture seems to have preceded the temple construction. The
Indian temple was built in accordance with aspirations of common people, with
stalls, markets and assembly halls ranged in its quadrangle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dr.
Radha Kamal Mukerjee in his “Social Function of Art” traces the origin of
temple construction to the original shape of a hut, resting on a central pole,
and surrounded by a circular wall with an inverted pot preventing the water
from trickling down the centre during the rainy season. He says: “The temple
rises skyward like the thatched conical hut of the Indian peasant, but since
the temple is the abode of God it is capped by the fruit <i>amalaka, </i>or the
inverted petals of the lotus flower, or the inverted water-jar (containing the
nectar of spiritual wisdom). The loftiest temple, with its shoulder-like
pinnacles spread out, looks like God himself wearing on his head a gorgeous
head-dress (<i>makuta</i>)<i> </i>or like the sacred mountain of India, Meru,
Mandara or Kailash, the abode of Siva. No doubt this architectural form
symbolises one of India’s profound spiritual convictions.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Indian temple Architecture incarnates the human spirit by its stress on
verticals, alternating light and shade in the arrangement of pyramidal towers
that taper off into the spire and then into the trident or disc. The trident is
the symbol of Siva’s power as the disc is that of Vishnu, and, like the cross
of European Churches, calls people from a distance to prayer. The design of the
spire is the distinctive excellence of Indian temple Architecture. In the North
Indian temple construction the refinement and beauty are derived from the
repetition of miniature turrets rhythmically rising tier upon tier on the sides
of the principal temple. In Orissan temples the verticals are pronounced,
rising almost parallel to one another, but soon incline inwards producing a
magnificent shoulder on which rests the <i>amalakasila </i>having the nectar
pot or trident. The entire composition of towers that rise by the side of towers,
gradually increasing in height, leads the Indian mind to the emptiness of the
sky, symbolised by Vishnu who pervades the sky and universe with blue colour.
From a distance the temple looks like a <i>Jata-Makuta </i>on the head of Siva
or like Mount Mandara, used as an instrument for churning the ocean. It is
noteworthy that the image of Vishnu who is a God pervading the universe stands
absolutely erect and immutable as a pillar, in the shrine. One the other hand,
the temple of Siva who is God pervading the self is often built like a
pyramidal tower with the solitary cell of yogic meditation. Here also the
temple rises tier upon tier until the last is crowned by a dome or cupola
representing the sky, or umbrella denoting the sovereignty of the Universe. Inside
the shrine the God is seated in his profound meditation or there is a formless
symbol, the Linga. Vishnu is the God representing the mind in activity that
upholds the Universe; Siva is the God representing the mind in repose that
withdraws itself from, or destroys, the Universe. A profound metaphysical
conception of the principles of cosmic evolution and involution has thus
differentiated the images in the temples of India along with their
architectural construction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Indian
temples have successive additions of enclosures, chambers and apartments
grouped round the original shrine. Dr. Radha Kamal Mukerjee observes: “It is
the mystery of God’s presence and the cults and observances of worship that
have governed the arrangement of the <i>Sanctum Sanctorum </i>or shrine cell
within the actual temple containing the image of God or his symbol. The
considerable height of the pyramidal roof of the shrine cell and its small
floor space contribute to envelop the God and pilgrim alike within the mystery,
darkness and silence that are stressed by the incense smoke and flickering
lamps with their trembling shadows. Indian temple architecture has not freed
itself from the earlier rock-cut caves in the treatment of the interior that is
kept dim or intensely dark for shutting out distractions for the contemplative
mind and maintaining an atmosphere of religious solemnity. The porch or
‘Mandapa’ always covers and precedes the door leading to the shrine cell. This
is lighted, spacious and full of pilgrim visitors. Then the space shrinks, the
corridor leading to the inner court is narrow, cramped and dark, permitting the
mind to concentrate towards the God. Mere closing of space and light and the
distribution of shadows are not enough for the Indian architect, for often be
makes the pilgrim suddenly climb up or descend by steep stairs to the enclosed
space in front of the ‘Sanctum’. Both the body and mind are thus pitched up to
an intense thrill of excitement in the vestibule leading to the shrine cell.
Thus far can the uninitiated proceed. As one tarries here and looks up and
around, he comes across a most mysterious and intricate architecture, a
bewildering assemblage of pillars and some of the most magnificent and majestic
images of gods and goddesses ever sculptured by man, who suddenly leap from
walls and pillars to life and suddenly beckon to him in the presence of dim and
fluttering lights. Such is the profusion of sculpture and ornamentation that
stir the spiritual emotions in the sacred doorway in front of the God in the
‘Sanctum’. The psychological effect of the half shadow and half darkness in the
day, and the full illumination of lamps in the night, in the dim gallery of the
Gods is profound. Here artistic ingenuity is in unison with religious
imagination.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

front of the assembly hall or ‘Mandapa’ there are spacious halls where pilgrims
gather for religious discussions and worship. </span><span style='font-size:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
thousands of pilgrims the Indian temple offers spacious pools, wells and
bathing places, kitchens and regular markets catering to the physical
requirements of life. The entire city assembles in the temple on a festive day,
wakes up the deity with morning music, bathes and feeds him and takes him out
in a procession with priests, dancing girls, and temple servants blowing
trumpets. The city is the temple and the temple is the city in Southern India.
The plan of the temple is reproduced in the city and <i>vice versa </i>as in
Srirangam, near Trichinopoly. Within the enclosure of a great temple there are
subsidiary shrines and halls that are symmetrically grouped around the central
shrine. It is thus that different religious concepts leave their indelible
impression on the architectural composition of the temple and city.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

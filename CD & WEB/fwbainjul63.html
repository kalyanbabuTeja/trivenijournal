<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Bain
wrote a biography, <i>Christina of Sweden, </i>and even his contribution to
Economics was of no mean order. He developed an intimate contact with Sanskrit
literature and Hindu mysticism, and wrote many tales with an Oriental setting
and after the technique of the Sanskrit story-tellers. The tales found a wide
enough reading public at one time, although they are more or less forgotten
now. Several of them, in fact, ran through many impressions, and some of them
found renderings into a few of the Indian languages. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is these Oriental Tales that mark Bain as a class by himself in Anglo-Indian
literature, and claim our memory for him. The matter and the manner are alike
Oriental and the Tales almost read like Sanskrit tales in sensitive
translation. Bain himself keeps up the illusion that they are translations from
original Sanskrit Manuscripts. Many a scholar was curiously taken in by this
illusion and even the British Museum Library thought it fit, </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>for
some time, to keep the volumes in the Oriental section. It is, of course, clear
now that the author of these tales is Bain himself, and the following was the
order of chronology in which they appeared: <i>A Digit of the Moon </i>(1898), <i>The
Descent of the Sun </i>(1903 March), <i>A Heifer of the Dawn </i>(1903
December), <i>In the Great God’s Hair </i>(1904), <i>A Draught of the Blue </i>(1905

<i>The Ashes of God </i>(1910), <i>Bubbles of the Foam </i>(1912), <i>A Syrup
of the Bees </i>(1914), <i>The Livery of Eve </i>(1916) and <i>The Substance of

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“In
<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>,”
Bain says, “religion and literature are inseparable.” All her great classics of
literature are imbued with a deep religious sense, and religion too found
literature its best medium. Her great poets were also seers, and the utterances
of her <span class=SpellE>rishis</span> were poetic.<i> </i>The theory of
reincarnation, life beyond life, <span class=GramE>the</span> emancipation of
the spirit–these are ideas which run in the heart and along the blood of an
Indian. Quest of peace rather than conquest of the world, and freeing of the
self rather than piling of pelf have ever been the aim of the Indian. Indeed,
there is a calm which is deep-rooted in the Indian soil, and the Indian soul
itself, which all the frenzy and tumult of the present day world is unable to
take away. The Indian approach to literature too has ever been religious rather
than aesthetic. The statement ‘Art is for Art’s sake’ at once <span
class=SpellE>appals</span> an Indian, because to him art, whether literature or
music or painting or sculpture, is a means of addressing God. Poetic
imagination was ever considered an opener of the doors of truth rather than a
play of the aesthetic fancy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is this mysticism of the Indian literature that has ever been a marvel to the
foreigner. When Tagore published his <i>Gitanjali, </i>the Europeans found in
it something which filled them with a sense of wonder, and the pure serenity and
simple profundity of its thoughts gave them an altogether new experience.
Accordingly, there have been many European writers who tried to grasp and graft
the Oriental mysticism into their writings. The uniqueness of Bain, however, is
that he did not satisfy himself with a spectator’s vision of Oriental thought
and mysticism, but essayed to capture the mind and heart of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> and the
very kernel of Hindu thought. In fact, his understanding of <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> and enjoyment of Indian literature were so
deep and genuine that he lashed out against Kipling and James Mill, who,
according to him, had no business to say anything about <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. “No
man,” </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>he says referring to <span class=GramE>Kipling,</span> “has
done more to caricature and misrepresent <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>,
in the interests of military vulgarity, than this </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>popular
writer, to whom <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is a book with seven seals.” Referring to the criticism of Indian ethic made by
James Mill, Bain says that it is a criminal offence, a sin against literature. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
mainstay of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
literary and cultural heritage is the Sanskrit language. The Sanskrit language
is verily the key to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and is the mother of most of the Indian languages. It is the language in which
the intuitive utterances of the Vedas and the Upanishads were preserved, and
alike the language in which the mighty epics of the Ramayana and the
Mahabharata were composed. Bain’s acquaintance with Sanskrit literature is
intimate, and he entered into its living spirit and felt its vital touch. He
was besides alive to the subtlest nuances of the Sanskrit language and drank
deep of its sheer beauty. “The Sanskrit language,” he says, “preserves an
element of charm, which in <st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place> too much
knowledge is destroying: the element of distance of the unknown, of that which
is outside the map, beyond, afar.” In another context, he refers to the verbal
sheen of the Sanskrit language, its “perpetual undercurrent of indirect
suggestion, <span class=GramE>a byplay</span> of allusion, a prismatic beauty,
of which no other language can convey the idea.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Bain,
however, was particularly drawn to the story literature in Sanskrit. He employs
in his Tales the technique of story-telling adapted by the story-tellers of
Sanskrit, and his style too by its elegance and ease, charm and quaintness
acquires a peculiar sweetness and music that is altogether Sanskrit-like. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
any language, the currency of tales and fables can be traced to times
immemorial as they are ever the means of pastime. The origin of the Sanskrit
popular tale may have been ‘such Vedic <span class=SpellE>Akhyanas</span> as
are preserved, for instance, in the <span class=SpellE>Rigvedic</span>
dialogue–the hymn of <span class=SpellE>Pururavas</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Urvasi</span>, or in such <span class=SpellE>Brahmanic</span>
legends as that of <span class=SpellE>Sunahsepa</span>.’ The three main sources
of story literature </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>at in </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sanskrit are the <span
class=SpellE>Avadana</span> type of literature–which includes the <span
class=SpellE>Jataka</span> literature–the <span class=SpellE>Panchatantra</span>
and the <span class=SpellE>Brihatkatha</span>. The first mentioned is the
earliest of the three. The <span class=SpellE>Avadana</span> stories have a
definite moral purpose, and belief in the efficacy of personal devotion to the
Buddha or his followers is their point. The <span class=SpellE>Panchatantra</span>
which is a sequence of <span class=GramE>texts,</span> belongs to the sixth
century and is in the form of instruction in state-craft and practical morality
offered by a Brahman by name <span class=SpellE>Vishnusarma</span> to the sons
of King <span class=SpellE>Amarasakti</span> of <span class=SpellE>Mahitaropya</span>
in <st1:place w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Deccan</span></st1:place>. The <span
class=SpellE>Brihatkatha</span>, however, has an altogether different story of
origin. It was recorded by <span class=SpellE>Gunadhya</span>, its author, in
the <span class=SpellE>Paisachi</span> dialect. It is the ostensible
reproduction of an original narration by Lord Siva to <span class=SpellE>Parvati</span>.
As many as seven <span class=SpellE>lakh</span> <span class=SpellE>slokas</span>
were first composed, although only one <span class=SpellE>lakh</span> of them
were finally spared and are now available. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
<span class=SpellE>Brihatkatha</span> has subsequently been adapted into
Sanskrit. The two adaptations of renown are <span class=SpellE>Kshemendra’s</span>
<span class=SpellE><i>Brihatkathamanjari</i></span><i> </i>and <span
class=SpellE>Somadeva’s</span> <span class=SpellE><i>Kathasaritsagara</i></span><i>.
</i>As far as we know from the adaptations, the <span class=SpellE>Brihatkatha</span>
narrates the story of <span class=SpellE>Naravahanadatta</span> who, in the
course of his adventures, marries a series of maidens, and finally attains the
empire of the <span class=SpellE>Vidyadharas</span>. While the <span
class=SpellE>Avadana</span> stories and the <span class=SpellE>Panchatantra</span>
stories also make delightful reading, the <span class=SpellE>Brihatkatha</span>
is unique by its deep human touch and by the witty raciness of its style. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mina was steeped in all these three types of story literature, and some of
their general devices are borrowed by him. Sometimes, however, single lines or
couplets are acknowledged as having Sanskrit originals. To give an example, the

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Firstly,
as in many Sanskrit tales, in Bain’s too Lord Siva and <span class=SpellE>Parvati</span>
are the invariable presiding deities. Excepting solitary instance of <i>An
Essence of the Dusk, </i>every story is narrated by Lord Siva to his darling
wife <span class=SpellE>Parvati</span>. This feature is probably borrowed from <span
class=SpellE>Somadeva</span>, because the <span class=SpellE><i>Kathasaritsagara</i></span><i>
</i>was originally narrated by Lord Siva to <span class=SpellE>Parvati</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Secondly,
as in Sanskrit, there is Benediction or Invocation at the beginning of every
story, and these are addressed to Lord Siva in his different aspects–Siva, the
Blue-Throated, the Lord of Time, the Destroyer of Time, the Wearer of the Moon
and the <st1:place w:st="on">Ganges</st1:place>. One of the invocations,
however, the one in <i>Bubbles of the Foam, </i>is addressed to the Lord of
Obstacles, <span class=SpellE>Vighneswara</span>, while another, the one <i>in
The Descent of the Sun, </i>is addressed to both <span class=SpellE>Vighneswara</span>,
This is typical of all Sanskrit writings, prose or poetry, as literature, more
often than not, has a social and religious purpose, and so the blessings of God
are sought. The device, besides, serves to strike the right mood in the
reader’s or onlooker’s mind. To give an example from Bain, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There is more, in fact,
in Bain’s borrowing of this<i> </i>Oriental device<i> </i>than meets the eye.
He seems to be an ardent devotee of Siva, as he himself says, “O Moony-crested,
be not angry: for surely I was thy worshipper of old, in some forgotten birth.”
He is<i> </i>even confident that no Indian equals him in his regard for Siva,
as he adds, “Is there among thy dusky millions, even one, who has so sincere a
regard for thy dead divinity, and for that of thy delicious little snowy bride,
as I?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thirdly,
following the custom of the Sanskrit story-tellers Bain too fixes a couplet or
sometimes a poem on the title<i> </i>page of his Tale. The lines sum up the
moral he intends to drive home in the course of the story. This feature, which
has a didactic purpose, is traceable to the <span class=SpellE>Jataka</span>
tales, and as <span class=SpellE>Dasgupta</span> points<i> </i>out, “the
tradition is current from the time<i> </i>of the <span class=SpellE>Brahmanas</span>
and the <span class=SpellE>Jatakas</span>.” These couplets or poems are again
borrowed from Sanskrit, whether from <span class=SpellE>Somadeva</span> or <span
class=SpellE>Vamana</span> or <span class=SpellE>Bhargava</span>. The
following, for example, is the poem that precedes the narration in <i>The

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
addition to these devices, Bain uses certain mystic symbols frequently to add
to the Oriental atmosphere of the Tales. The <span class=SpellE>colour</span>
blue and the setting sun are among such symbols. The <span class=SpellE>colour</span>
blue is instinct with the mysticism that is characteristic of India and Indian
literature, as he says “….Something of this, indeed is readily intelligible in
every land: but in India, it is more so. The blue is bluer there.” The eyes of <span
class=SpellE>Anushayini</span> in <i>Descent of Sun </i>are blue, and even when
she is born as <span class=SpellE>Shri</span> as a result of the curse, her
eyes continue to be blue. The king in <i>A Draught of the Blue </i>takes a <i>blue
</i>liquor from the merchant and dreams a dream in which he sees his wife with <i>blue
</i>eyes and wearing <i>blue </i>flowers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
other frequently employed symbol is sunset, which is symbolic of the mystery
that surrounds the cycle of birth and death. In <i>The Descent of the Sun, </i><span
class=SpellE>Shri</span> finds her lover just before sunset, and in <i>The
Substance of a Dream, </i><span class=SpellE>Taravali</span> meets <span
class=SpellE>Shatrunjaya</span> daily at the time of sunset. When <span
class=SpellE>Shatrunjaya</span> goes to his kingdom after hearing from his
mother, he comes to know his that his father died at the time of sunset. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>With
these and diverse other symbols which are familiar in Sanskrit story
literature–moon and lotus, dawn and dusk, nectar and poison, wood and lake–Bain
succeeds in evoking an atmosphere of mystic charm and quaint evasiveness that <span
class=SpellE>characterises</span> the Sanskrit stories. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

themes are, more or less, different tunes of the same melody, although the
melody is sweet enough to bear repetition. Most of the stories are about men
who start as misogynists and end as obedient servants of Women. Bain too has no
heroes, but only heroines. Whether it is <span class=SpellE>Anangaraba</span>
untying the riddles of scores of suitors, or <span class=SpellE>Wanavallari</span>
arguing with and convincing <span class=SpellE>Indra</span>, or <span
class=SpellE>Madhupamanjari</span> teaching her husband what a woman is, or the
princess in <i>A Mine of Faults </i>explaining to the king what life without a
woman is, or <span class=SpellE>Taravali</span> teaching <span class=SpellE>Shatrunjaya</span>
the psychology of woman–they are all a galaxy of beautiful women, whose beauty
is enhanced by their nobility and courage, wisdom and resourcefulness. The idea
of reincarnation is also brought out in almost all the stories. They are all
cast on a cosmic canvas with Lord Siva and <span class=SpellE>Parvati</span> as
the presiding deities, and the lives of men and women are but the fleeting
scenes used to illustrate and <span class=SpellE>symbolise</span> the higher
truths of life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
titles of Bain’s Tales are meaningful too, and add to the atmosphere. Equally
suggestive titles are chosen for parts of a book as well: in <i>An Essence of
the Dark, </i>the three titles of the parts of the book are (<span
class=SpellE>i</span>) <i>A Haunted Beauty </i>(ii) <i>A total Eclipse </i>and
(iii) <i>A Fatal Kiss. </i>Bain refers, in the preface of the book, to the lunar
eclipse: beauty being persecuted by serpent. When the moon is eclipsed, there
is darkness, gloom and dusk. So too, when on account of the witchery of <span
class=SpellE>Natabhrukuti</span>, <span class=SpellE>Aja</span> is killed, it
is beauty persecuted by serpent. What remains in the end is nothing but the
essence of the dusk. A Haunted Beauty refers to <span class=SpellE>Yasovati</span>,
who becomes the target of <span class=SpellE>Natabhrukuti’s</span> revenge. She
is beauty haunted by jealousy. After <span class=SpellE>Aja</span> gets upon
the terrace wall, <span class=SpellE>Natabhrukuti</span> sees him and loves him
at first sight. She wants to make him forget all about <span class=SpellE>Yasovati</span>,
her competitor, and subjects him to her witchery. As a result of that, <span
class=SpellE>Aja</span> finds himself in a different world altogether. When the
moon is under the influence of the serpent, it is a total eclipse. So, a total
eclipse refers to <span class=SpellE>Aja</span> under the influence of <span
class=SpellE>Natabhrukuti’s</span> sorcery. <i>A Fatal Kiss </i>is the last
part of the story: <span class=SpellE>Natabhrukuti</span> kissing <span
class=SpellE>Aja</span> and putting him to death. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is now pertinent to see if one could continue to call the writings of
Bain–Tales; or, should they be called romances or novels? A novel, according to
the Concise Oxford Dictionary, is a fictitious narrative of sufficient length
to fill one or more volumes portraying characters and incidents representative
of real life in a continuous plot. If this definition is valid, we cannot,
perhaps, call Bain’s writings novels, because they scarcely represent
situations from real life, although they present certain truths of life.
Characters too there are, but there is no drama emerging out of any situation.
No element of surprise or suspense is ever present. With so many ingredients
wanting, it is perhaps neither appropriate nor tenable to call them novels. The
term romance would probably be fitting, as the whole atmosphere of the writings
is exotic and as the stress is on the inner life of imagination rather than the
outer life of actuality. Besides, the love that is portrayed by Bain has a
transcendent permanence. The style too is sensitive and often poetic, and so it
would perhaps be apt to call them romantic tales. But, then, what is in a name,
after all? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Finally,
it cannot be denied that one experiences a feeling of satiety after reading a
few of Bain’s Tales. It is said also of Ivy-Compton Burnett’s novels and even
of Tagore’s collections of English poems, that to read one is to read all, as
the theme and the tone, the scheme and the setting are ever similar. In Bain’s
Tales too, the variables are few and the constants many. The thought behind the
Tales, and the technique and style adapted are too similar to ward off
monotony. But, the feeling of sameness and even monotony is exceeded by the
atmosphere of serenity which seems to fill these stories. To read and to ponder
over these stories is indeed to grow in wisdom and experience a sense </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of
peace. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Bain’s
Tales, in fact, have a special appeal to the Indian, because in them he finds
the meaning and melody of his Sanskrit stories with a new ring and lilt. They
also demonstrate how a spiritual oneness can transcend racial and national
barriers and make an ardent Indian of a visiting Englishman. But, then, the
Tales of Bain are mainly meant for the Englishman. Bain even guides the Englishman’s
pronunciation of the Sanskrit words he uses. The Englishman has, of course, the
<i>Arabian Nights </i>and the <span class=SpellE><i>Decameron</i></span><i>, </i>if
he wants to read tales; but, the Tales of Bain take him into an altogether
different world–the world of mysticism–and make an altogether new appeal to
him, and both amuse and edify.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
